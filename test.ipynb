Massive, centrally operated mainframe computers from a few players gave way to smaller, more efficient machines accessible to enterprises and research institutions. In the decades that followed, incremental advances yielded home computers that hobbyists could tinker with. In time, powerful personal computers with intuitive no-code interfaces became ubiquitous.\\nGenerative AI has already reached its “hobbyist” phase—and as with computers, further progress aims to attain greater performance in smaller packages. 2023 saw an explosion of increasingly efficient foundation models with open licenses, beginning with the launch of Meta’s LlaMa family of large language models (LLMs) and followed by the likes of StableLM, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. DeepFloyd and Stable Diffusion have achieved relative parity with leading proprietary models. Enhanced with fine-tuning techniques and datasets developed by the open source community, many open models can now outperform all but the most powerful closed-source models on most benchmarks, despite far smaller parameter counts.\\nAs the pace of progress accelerates, the ever-expanding capabilities of state-of-the-art models will garner the most media attention. But the most impactful developments may be those focused on governance, middleware, training techniques and data pipelines that make generative AI more trustworthy, sustainable and accessible, for enterprises and end users alike.\\nHere are some important current AI trends to look out for in the coming year.\\nReality check: more realistic expectationsMultimodal AISmall(er) language models and open source advancementsGPU shortages and cloud costsModel optimization is getting more accessibleCustomized local models and data pipelinesMore powerful virtual agentsRegulation, copyright and ethical AI concernsShadow AI (and corporate AI policies)\\n\\n\\n\\nReality check: more realistic expectations\\n\\n\\nWhen generative AI first hit mass awareness, a typical business leader’s knowledge came mostly from marketing materials and breathless news coverage. Tangible experience (if any) was limited to messing around with ChatGPT and DALL-E. Now that the dust has settled, the business community now has a more refined understanding of AI-powered solutions.\\nThe Gartner Hype Cycle positions Generative AI squarely at “Peak of Inflated Expectations,” on the cusp of a slide into the “Trough of Disillusionment”[1]—in other words, about to enter a (relatively) underwhelming transition period—while Deloitte’s “State of Generated AI in the Enterprise “ report from Q1 2024 indicated that many leaders “expect substantial transformative impacts in the short term.”[2] The reality will likely fall in between: generative AI offers unique opportunities and solutions, but it will not be everything to everyone.\\nHow real-world results compare to the hype is partially a matter of perspective. Standalone tools like ChatGPT typically take center stage in the popular imagination, but smooth integration into established services often yields more staying power. Prior to the current hype cycle, generative machine learning tools like the “Smart Compose” feature rolled out by Google in 2018 weren’t heralded as a paradigm shift, despite being harbingers of today’s text generating services. Similarly, many high-impact generative AI tools are being implemented as integrated elements of enterprise environments that enhance and complement, rather than revolutionize or replace, existing tools: for example, “Copilot” features in Microsoft Office, “Generative Fill” features in Adobe Photoshop or virtual agents in productivity and collaboration apps.\\nWhere generative AI first builds momentum in everyday workflows will have more influence on the future of AI tools than the hypothetical upside of any specific AI capabilities. According to a recent IBM survey of over 1,000 employees at enterprise-scale companies, the top three factors driving AI adoption were advances in AI tools that make them more accessible, the need to reduce costs and automate key processes and the increasing amount of AI embedded into standard off-the-shelf business applications.\\n\\n\\n\\nMultimodal AI (and video)\\n\\n\\nThat being said, the ambition of state-of-the-art generative AI is growing. The next wave of advancements will focus not only on enhancing performance within a specific domain, but on multimodal models that can take multiple types of data as input. While models that operate across different data modalities are not a strictly new phenomenon—text-to-image models like CLIP and speech-to-text models like Wave2Vec have been around for years now—they’ve typically only operated in one direction, and were trained to accomplish a specific task.\\nThe incoming generation of interdisciplinary models, comprising proprietary models like OpenAI’s GPT-4V or Google’s Gemini, as well as open source models like LLaVa, Adept or Qwen-VL, can move freely between natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. New models are also bringing video into the fold: in late January, Google announced Lumiere, a text-to-video diffusion model that can also perform image-to-video tasks or use images for style reference.\\nThe most immediate benefit of multimodal AI is more intuitive, versatile AI applications and virtual assistants. Users can, for example, ask about an image and receive a natural language answer, or ask out loud for instructions to repair something and receive visual aids alongside step-by-step text instructions.\\nOn a higher level, multimodal AI allows for a model to process more diverse data inputs, enriching and expanding the information available for training and inference. Video, in particular, offers great potential for holistic learning. “There are cameras that are on 24/7 and they’re capturing what happens just as it happens without any filtering, without any intentionality,” says Peter Norvig, Distinguished Education Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).[3] “AI models haven’t had that kind of data before. Those models will just have a better understanding of everything.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSmall(er) language models and open source advancements\\n\\n\\nIn domain-specific models—particularly LLMs—we’ve likely reached the point of diminishing returns from larger parameter counts. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI (whose GPT-4 model is rumored to have around 1.76 trillion parameters), suggested as much at MIT’s Imagination in Action event last April: “I think we’re at the end of the era where it’s going to be these giant models, and we’ll make them better in other ways,” he predicted. “I think there’s been way too much focus on parameter count.”\\nMassive models jumpstarted this ongoing AI golden age, but they’re not without drawbacks. Only the very largest companies have the funds and server space to train and maintain energy-hungry models with hundreds of billions of parameters. According to one estimate from the University of Washington, training a single GPT-3-sized model requires the yearly electricity consumption of over 1,000 households; a standard day of ChatGPT queries rivals the daily energy consumption of 33,000 U.S. households.[4]\\nSmaller models, meanwhile, are far less resource-intensive. An influential March 2022 paper\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) from Deepmind demonstrated that training smaller models on more data yields better performance than training larger models on fewer data. Much of the ongoing innovation in LLMs has thus focused on yielding greater output from fewer parameters. As demonstrated by recent progress of models in the 3–70 billion parameter range, particularly those built upon LLaMa, Llama 2 and Mistral foundation models in 2023, models can be downsized without much performance sacrifice.\\nThe power of open models will continue to grow. In December of 2023, Mistral released “Mixtral,” a mixture of experts (MoE) model integrating 8 neural networks, each with 7 billion parameters. Mistral claims that Mixtral not only outperforms the 70B parameter variant of Llama 2 on most benchmarks at 6 times faster inference speeds, but that it even matches or outperforms OpenAI’s far larger GPT-3.5 on most standard benchmarks. Shortly thereafter, Meta announced in January that it has already begun training of Llama 3 models, and confirmed that they will be open sourced. Though details (like model size) have not been confirmed, it’s reasonable to expect Llama 3 to follow the framework established in the two generations prior.\\nThese advances in smaller models have three important benefits:\\nThey help democratize AI: smaller models that can be run at lower cost on more attainable hardware empower more amateurs and institutions to study, train and improve existing models.They can be run locally on smaller devices: this allows more sophisticated AI in scenarios like edge computing and the internet of things (IoT). Furthermore, running models locally—like on a user’s smartphone—helps to sidestep many privacy and cybersecurity concerns that arise from interaction with sensitive personal or proprietary data.They make AI more explainable: the larger the model, the more difficult it is to pinpoint how and where it makes important decisions. Explainable AI is essential to understanding, improving and trusting the output of AI systems.\\n\\n\\n\\nGPU shortages and cloud costs\\n\\n\\nThe trend toward smaller models will be driven as much by necessity as by entrepreneurial vigor, as cloud computing costs increase as the availability of hardware decrease.\\n“The big companies (and more of them) are all trying to bring AI capabilities in-house, and there is a bit of a run on GPUs,” says James Landay, Vice-Director and Faculty Director of Research, Stanford HAI. “This will create a huge pressure not only for increased GPU production, but for innovators to come up with hardware solutions that are cheaper and easier to make and use.”1\\nAs a late 2023 O’Reilly report explains, cloud providers currently bear much of the computing burden: relatively few AI adopters maintain their own infrastructure, and hardware shortages will only elevate the hurdles and costs of setting up on-premise servers. In the long term, this may put upward pressure on cloud costs as providers update and optimize their own infrastructure to effectively meet demand from generative AI.[5]\\nFor enterprises, navigating this uncertain landscape requires flexibility, in terms of both models–leaning on smaller, more efficient models where necessary or larger, more performant models when practical–and deployment environment. “We don’t want to constrain where people deploy [a model],” said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna in a December 2023 interview with CNBC\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com), in reference to IBM’s watsonx platform. “So [if] they want to deploy it on a large public cloud, we’ll do it there. If they want to deploy it at IBM, we’ll do it at IBM. If they want to do it on their own, and they happen to have enough infrastructure, we’ll do it there.”\\n\\n\\n\\nModel optimization is getting more accessible\\n\\n\\nThe trend towards maximizing the performance of more compact models is well served by the recent output of the open source community.\\xa0\\nMany key advancements have been (and will continue to be) driven not just by new foundation models, but by new techniques and resources (like open source datasets) for training, tweaking, fine-tuning or aligning pre-trained models. Notable model-agnostic techniques that took hold in 2023 include:\\nLow Rank Adaptation (LoRA): Rather than directly fine-tuning billions of model parameters, LoRA entails freezing pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable layers—which represent the matrix of changes to model weights as 2 smaller (lower rank) matrices—in each transformer block. This dramatically reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated, which, in turn, dramatically speeds up fine-tuning and reduces memory needed to store model updates.Quantization: Like lowering the bitrate of audio or video to reduce file size and latency, quantization lowers the precision used to represent model data points—for example, from 16-bit floating point to 8-bit integer—to reduce memory usage and speed up inference. QLoRA techniques combine quantization with LoRA.Direct Preference Optimization (DPO): Chat models typically use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align model outputs to human preferences. Though powerful, RLHF is complex and unstable. DPO promises similar benefits while being computationally lightweight and substantially simpler.\\nAlongside parallel advances in open source models in the 3–70 billion parameter space,\\xa0these evolving techniques could shift the dynamics of the AI landscape by providing smaller players, like startups and amateurs, with sophisticated AI capabilities that were previously out of reach.\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomized local models and data pipelines\\n\\n\\nEnterprises in 2024 can thus pursue differentiation through bespoke model development, rather than building wrappers around repackaged services from “Big AI.” With the right data and development framework, existing open source AI models and tools can be tailored to almost any real-world scenario, from customer support uses to supply chain management to complex document analysis.\\nOpen source models afford organizations the opportunity to develop powerful custom AI models—trained on their proprietary data and fine-tuned for their specific needs—quickly, without prohibitively expensive infrastructure investments. This is especially relevant in domains like legal, healthcare or finance, where highly specialized vocabulary and concepts may not have been learned by foundation models in pre-training.\\nLegal, finance and healthcare are also prime examples of industries that can benefit from models small enough to be run locally on modest hardware. Keeping AI training, inference and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) local avoids the risk of proprietary data or sensitive personal information being used to train closed-source models or otherwise pass through the hands of third parties. And using RAG to access relevant information rather than storing all knowledge directly within the LLM itself helps reduce model size, further increasing speed and reducing costs.\\nAs 2024 continues to level the model playing field, competitive advantage will increasingly be driven by proprietary data pipelines that enable industry-best fine-tuning.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore powerful virtual agents\\n\\n\\nWith more sophisticated, efficient tools and a year’s worth of market feedback at their disposal, businesses are primed to expand the use cases for virtual agents beyond just straightforward customer experience chatbots.\\nAs AI systems speed up and incorporate new streams and formats of information, they expand the possibilities for not just communication and instruction following, but also task automation. “2023 was the year of being able to chat with an AI. Multiple companies launched something, but the interaction was always you type something in and it types something back,” says Stanford’s Norvig. “In 2024, we’ll see the ability for agents to get stuff done for you. Make reservations, plan a trip, connect to other services.”\\nMultimodal AI, in particular, significantly increases opportunities for seamless interaction with virtual agents. For example, rather than simply asking a bot for recipes, a user can point a camera at an open fridge and request recipes that can be made with available ingredients. Be My Eyes, a mobile app that connects blind and low vision individuals with volunteers to help with quick tasks, is piloting AI tools that help users directly interact with their surroundings through multimodal AI in lieu of awaiting a human volunteer.\\nExplore IBM watsonx™ Assistant: market-leading conversational AI with seamless integration for the tools that power your business →\\n\\n\\n\\nRegulation, copyright and ethical AI concerns\\n\\n\\nElevated multimodal capabilities and lowered barriers to entry also open up new doors for abuse: deepfakes, privacy issues, perpetuation of bias and even evasion of CAPTCHA safeguards may become increasingly easy for bad actors. In January of 2024, a wave of explicit celebrity deepfakes hit social media; research from May 2023 indicated that there had been 8 times as many voice deepfakes posted online compared to the same period in 2022.[6]\\nAmbiguity in the regulatory environment may slow adoption, or at least more aggressive implementation, in the short to medium term. There is inherent risk to any major, irreversible investment in an emerging technology or practice that might require significant retooling—or even become illegal—following new legislation or changing political headwinds in the coming years.\\nIn December 2023, the European Union (EU) reached provisional agreement on the Artificial Intelligence Act\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com). Among other measures, it prohibits indiscriminate scraping of images to create facial recognition databases, biometric categorization systems with potential for discriminatory bias, “social scoring” systems and the use of AI for social or economic manipulation. It also seeks to define a category of “high-risk” AI systems, with potential to threaten safety, fundamental rights or rule of law, that will be subject to additional oversight. Likewise, it sets transparency requirements for what it calls “general-purpose AI (GPAI)” systems—foundation models—including technical documentation and systemic adversarial testing.\\nBut while some key players, like Mistral, reside in the EU, the majority of groundbreaking AI development is happening in America, where substantive legislation of AI in the private sector will require action from Congress—which may be unlikely in an election year. On October 30, the Biden administration issued a comprehensive executive order\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) detailing 150 requirements for use of AI technologies by federal agencies; months prior, the administration secured voluntary commitments from prominent AI developers\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com)\\xa0to adhere to certain guardrails for trust and security. Notably, both California and Colorado are actively pursuing their own legislation regarding individuals’ data privacy rights with regard to artificial intelligence.\\nChina has moved more proactively toward formal AI restrictions, banning price discrimination by recommendation algorithms on social media and mandating the clear labeling of AI-generated content. Prospective regulations on generative AI seek to require the training data used to train LLMs and the content subsequently generated by models must be “true and accurate,” which experts have taken to indicate measures to censor LLM output.\\nMeanwhile, the role of copyrighted material in the training of AI models used for content generation, from language models to image generators and video models, remains a hotly contested issue. The outcome of the high-profile lawsuit filed by the New York Times against OpenAI\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) may significantly affect the trajectory of AI legislation. Adversarial tools, like Glaze\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) and Nightshade\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com)—both developed at the University of Chicago—have arisen in what may become an arms race of sorts between creators and model developers.\\n\\n\\n\\nShadow AI (and corporate AI policies)\\n\\n\\nFor businesses, this escalating potential for legal, regulatory, economic or reputational consequences is compounded by how popular and accessible generative AI tools have become. Organizations must not only have a careful, coherent and clearly articulated corporate policy around generative AI, but also be wary of\\xa0shadow AI:\\xa0the “unofficial” personal use of AI in the workplace by employees.\\nAlso dubbed “shadow IT” or “BYOAI,” shadow AI arises when impatient employees seeking quick solutions (or simply wanting to explore new tech faster than a cautious company policy allows) implement generative AI in the workplace without going through IT for approval or oversight. Many consumer-facing services, some free of charge, allow even nontechnical individuals to improvise the use of generative AI tools. In one study from Ernst & Young, 90% of respondents said they use AI at work.[7]\\nThat enterprising spirit can be great, in a vacuum—but eager employees may lack relevant information or perspective regarding security, privacy or compliance. This can expose businesses to a great deal of risk. For example, an employee might unknowingly feed trade secrets to a public-facing AI model that continually trains on user input, or use copyright-protected material to train a proprietary model for content generation and expose their company to legal action.\\nLike many ongoing developments, this underscores how the dangers of generative AI rise almost linearly with its capabilities. With great power comes great responsibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoving forward\\n\\n\\nAs we proceed through a pivotal year in artificial intelligence, understanding and adapting to emerging trends is essential to maximizing potential, minimizing risk and responsibly scaling generative AI adoption.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Author\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDave Bergmann\\nWriter,  Data & AI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Footnotes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1“Gartner Places Generative AI on the Peak of Inflated Expectations on the 2023 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0Gartner, 16 August 2023\\n2\\xa0”Deloitte’s State of Generative AI in the Enteprrise Quarter one report”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0Deloitte, January 2024\\n3\\xa0”What to Expect in AI in 2024”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0Stanford University, 8 December 2023\\n4\\xa0”Q&A: UW researcher discusses just how much energy ChatGPT uses”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0University of Washington, 27 July 2023\\n5\\xa0“Generative AI in the Enterprise”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0O’Reilly, 28 November 2023\\n6\\xa0”Deepfaking it: America’s 2024 election coincides with AI boom”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0Reuters, 30 May 2023\\n7\\xa0”How organizations can stop skyrocketing AI use from fueling anxiety”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0Ernst & Young, December 2023\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn how IBM® watsonx.governance™ accelerates responsible, transparent and explainable AI workflows →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPut generative AI to work with watsonx™\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn how IBM can empower you to stay ahead of AI trends\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n')],\n",

This year, AI is expected to become more accessible, nuanced and integrated in technologies that improve everyday tasks and help solve some of the world’s most challenging problems. \\nHere are three important AI trends to keep an eye on in 2024. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmall language models\\n\\n\\n\\n                                You’ve experienced the power of large language models (LLMs) if you’ve used Copilot to answer complex questions. The models are so large that they can require significant computing resources to run, making the rise of small language models (SLMs) a big deal. \\nSLMs are still quite large with several billion parameters — in contrast to hundreds of billions of parameters in LLMs — but they’re small enough to run on a phone offline. Parameters are variables, or adjustable elements, that determine a model’s behavior. \\n“Small language models can make AI more accessible due to their size and affordability,” says Sebastien Bubeck, who leads the Machine Learning Foundations group at Microsoft Research. “At the same time, we’re discovering new ways to make them as powerful as large language models.” \\nMicrosoft researchers have developed and released two SLMs — Phi and Orca— that perform as well as or better than large language models in certain areas, challenging the notion that scale is required for performance. \\nUnlike LLMs trained on vast amounts of internet data, the smaller models use curated, high-quality training data, with researchers finding new thresholds for size and performance. This year, you can expect to see improved models designed to foster more research and innovation. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMultimodal AI\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Most LLMs can process only one data type — text — but multimodal models can understand information from different data types like text, images, audio and video. This capability is making technologies from search tools to creativity apps richer and more accurate and seamless. \\nYou can find out from Copilot what’s happening in an uploaded image, thanks to a multimodal model that can process images, natural language and Bing search data. Copilot can generate, for example, relevant information like the historical significance of a monument in your photo. \\nMultimodal AI is also powering Microsoft Designer,a graphic design app that can generate images based on a description of what you want. And it enables custom neural voices, or natural-sounding voices useful in text readers and tools for people with vocal disabilities. \\n“Multimodality has the power to create more human-like experiences that can better take advantage of the range of senses we use as humans, such as sight, speech and hearing,” says Jennifer Marsman, principal engineer for Microsoft’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer, Kevin Scott. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI in science\\n\\n\\n\\n                                Experts are anticipating major gains in AI tools designed to speed up scientific discoveries, with much of the work aimed at addressing global problems like climate change, energy crises and diseases. \\nTo mitigate climate change and help farmers work more efficiently, Microsoft researchers are using AI to build better weather predictors, carbon estimators and other  tools for sustainable agriculture.They’re also developing AI technologies that will help farmers in the field, including a chatbot that can help a farmer identify a mysterious weed or compare the efficiency of different irrigation methods using farm-specific data.\\nIn life sciences, researchers are collaborating on the  world’s largest image-based AI model to fight cancer and using advanced AI to find  new drugs for infectious diseasesand new molecules for breakthrough medicines.The technology is compressing scientific trial and error — work that can take years — into just a few weeks or months. \\nAI is also transforming materials science, a broad field focused on creating new materials with specific properties. One recent breakthrough showcased the power of AI and high-performance computing toaccelerate the search for less toxic battery materials. \\n“Artificial intelligence is driving a revolution in scientific discovery,” says Chris Bishop, director of theAI4Science team at Microsoft Research. “That may turn out to be the most exciting, and ultimately the most important, application of AI.” \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet all the latest news and learn more about what’s next at Understanding AI at Microsoft. \\n\\xa0\\nIllustrations by Makeshift Studios / Michal Bednarski\\nStory published on February 12, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow us:\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare this page:\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat's new\\n\\n\\nSurface Pro\\n\\n\\nSurface Laptop\\n\\n\\nSurface Laptop Studio 2\\n\\n\\nSurface Laptop Go 3\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Copilot\\n\\n\\nAI in Windows\\n\\n\\nExplore Microsoft products\\n\\n\\nWindows 11 apps\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Store\\n\\n\\nAccount profile\\n\\n\\nDownload Center\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Store support\\n\\n\\nReturns\\n\\n\\nOrder tracking\\n\\n\\nCertified Refurbished\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Store Promise\\n\\n\\nFlexible Payments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEducation\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft in education\\n\\n\\nDevices for education\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Teams for Education\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft 365 Education\\n\\n\\nHow to buy for your school\\n\\n\\nEducator training and development\\n\\n\\nDeals for students and parents\\n\\n\\nAzure for students\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Cloud\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Security\\n\\n\\nDynamics 365\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft 365\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Power Platform\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Teams\\n\\n\\nCopilot for Microsoft 365\\n\\n\\nSmall Business\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDeveloper & IT\\n\\n\\nAzure\\n\\n\\nDeveloper Center\\n\\n\\nDocumentation\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Learn\\n\\n\\nMicrosoft Tech Community\\n\\n\\nAzure Marketplace\\n\\n\\nAppSource\\n\\n\\nVisual Studio\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompany\\n\\n\\nCareers\\n\\n\\nAbout Microsoft\\n\\n\\nCompany news\\n\\n\\nPrivacy at Microsoft\\n\\n\\nInvestors\\n\\n\\nDiversity and inclusion\\n\\n\\nAccessibility\\n\\n\\nSustainability\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnglish (United States)\\n\\n\\nYour Privacy Choices Opt-Out Icon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour Privacy Choices\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour Privacy Choices Opt-Out Icon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour Privacy Choices\\n\\n\\n\\nConsumer Health Privacy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSitemap\\n\\n\\nContact Microsoft\\n\\n\\nPrivacy \\n\\n\\nManage cookies\\n\\n\\nTerms of use\\n\\n\\nTrademarks\\n\\n\\nSafety & eco\\n\\n\\nRecycling\\n\\n\\nAbout our ads\\n\\n© Microsoft 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\")],\n",

Though barriers to entry due to cost and ease of use may have crumbled in recent years, there are still issues around trust, bias, accessibility and regulation.\\n\\n\\nFocusing on solving these problems could put us on track to unlocking the full potential of AI as we head towards the second half of the decade.\\n\\nBeyond Words And Pictures\\nThe next generation of generative AI tools will go far beyond the chatbots and image generators that have amazed and sometimes scared us in 2023. Generative video and music creators are already appearing, and they will become more powerful and user-friendly. We will start to see them embedded into creative platforms and productivity tools, just as we have seen with ChatGPT technology this year. New and exciting applications will appear, such as generative design tools and voice synthesizers. Being able to tell the difference between the real and the computer-generated will become an increasingly valuable tool in the critical skills toolbox!\\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024ByKevin PayneContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024ByCassidy HortonContributor\\nEthical AI\\nAI has the potential to be so disruptive that it’s essential that it is developed and used in a responsible way that minimizes its potential to cause harm. We already know some of the dangerous factors – bias, a lack of transparency, the potential to displace human jobs and our inability to say, with 100 percent certainty, that it’s never going to get out of control. In 2024, we will see continued focus on mitigating these problems and remaining vigilant for new ones. AI ethicists will be increasingly in demand as businesses seem to demonstrate that they are adhering to ethical standards and deploying appropriate safeguards.\\n\\nAI In Customer Service\\nCustomer service can be an area of business operations where a lot of routine, repetitive procedures are interspersed with occasional deeply complex and critical tasks. This makes it an ideal testbed for integrating AI into processes, automating the mundane in order to free up human time for issues that need a human touch. AI can be used to triage initial contact calls, generate personalized solutions to common problems, and generate reports and summaries of customer interactions. A Boston Consulting Group survey found that 95 percent of customer service leaders expect their customers will be served by AI bots at some point in the next three years.\\n\\n\\nAugmented Working\\nUnderstanding how we can augment our human intelligence and capabilities in order to do our jobs faster, more efficiently and more safely will be an important workplace skill in 2024. If you’re a legal eagle, it will help you quickly summarize relevant case law or speed up the drafting of contracts. Doctors will use it to assist them in writing up patient notes or medical images. Coders will use it to speed up writing software and to test and debug their output. If you're a student, it can help you organize notes and research, and if you're unemployed, it will help you write your CV and draft cover letters.\\nAI-Augmented Apps\\nThis year, everyone was rushing to build generative AI functions into their software and applications. From search engines like Bing and Google to productivity tools like Office, social apps like Snapchat, and industry-specific platforms such as Expedia (travel) and Coursera (education), adding chatbot functionality is emerging as an effective strategy for driving next-generation customer experience. Service providers may have been holding off due to uncertainty over data protection and customer privacy issues, but these should start to be resolved as AI providers adapt their services to meet market requirements. An example is Adobe’s integration of generative AI into its Firefly design tools, trained entirely on proprietary data, to alleviate fears that copyright and ownership could be a problem in the future.\\nLow-Code And No-Code Software Engineering\\nBack in 2019, Gartner predicted that 65 percent of application development would be done with low-code/no-code tools by 2024. This may very well turn out to be correct, as generative AI tools like ChatGPT allow anyone to create and test applications in a matter of minutes. Although I don’t see coding and software engineering jobs vanishing in 2024 (someone needs to make the AI tools in the first place, after all), there will be a lot of exciting opportunities for people who have good ideas and a love of solving problems, but not necessarily hard technical skills.\\nAI Jobs\\nIf you want to work in AI but don’t want to be a computer scientist, then good news – a whole load of new job opportunities are opening up in 2024 that could suit you. As well as the engineers and technicians needed to build systems, we’ll see openings for roles such as prompt engineers, who create the instructions to tell AI applications what to do, and AI managers, who oversee teams of virtual workers. There will also be a growing need for AI project managers, trainers, and ethicists. On the other hand, if you are a techie, there will be plenty of new jobs for you, too, in fields like AI engineering and DevOps.\\nQuantum AI\\nPerhaps not a trend that will affect everyone right away. But quantum computing – capable of massively speeding up certain calculation-heavy compute workloads – is increasingly being found to have applications in AI. Quantum algorithms process data using qubits that spookily exist in more than one state at a time, as opposed to traditional computer bits that can only ever be 1 or 0. This is one of the features that makes them far more efficient than classical algorithms for problems like optimization – determining the best combinations of many different variables – that are commonly tackled with machine learning. During 2024, I expect to see more progress in applying quantum computing in order to power ever larger and more complex neural networks and algorithms.\\nUpskilling For The AI Revolution\\nIt's frequently said these days that AI won't take jobs, but people who use AI will take jobs from those who don't. If you want to get ahead, understanding how AI impacts your own job or profession and developing the ability to match the right tool to the task is a super-smart idea. Forward-looking employers will be looking to assist their workforces in this transition by integrating AI skills into education and training programs. If yours isn’t, there’s a huge number of resources online, many of them free. So dive in, and you’ll be able to find a much better employer in no time!\\nAI Legislation\\nLegislators have never been great at keeping pace with technology, but the obviously game-changing nature of AI is starting to make them sit up and take note. China already has some laws in place – including laws prohibiting the production of non-consensual deepfakes. And jurisdictions, including the EU, US and India, are developing their own sets of regulations. The UK has proposed a bill that will potentially come into force in 2024, and an EU act is predicted to be in place by the start of 2025. Each piece of legislation will seek to strike a balance between protecting citizens from the negative impact of AI on jobs and privacy, for example, and enabling innovation and commerce. The debate around where the lines are drawn is likely to be a prominent element of political discourse during 2024.\\n\\nRead more about these topics in my book, The Future Internet: How the Metaverse, Web 3.0, and Blockchain Will Transform Business and Society and ‘Business Trends in Practice, which won the 2022 Business Book of the Year award.

The past year\\'s developments, from a vibrant open source landscape to sophisticated multimodal models, have laid the groundwork for significant advances in AI.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut although generative AI continues to captivate the tech world, attitudes are becoming more nuanced and mature as organizations shift their focus from experimentation to real-world initiatives. This year\\'s trends reflect a deepening sophistication and caution in AI development and deployment strategies, with an eye to ethics, safety and the evolving regulatory landscape.\\nHere are the top 10 AI and machine learning trends to prepare for in 2024.\\n\\n1. Multimodal AI\\nMultimodal AI goes beyond traditional single-mode data processing to encompass multiple input types, such as text, images and sound -- a step toward mimicking the human ability to process diverse sensory information.\\n\"The interfaces of the world are multimodal,\" said Mark Chen, head of frontiers research at OpenAI, in a November 2023 presentation at the conference EmTech MIT. \"We want our models to see what we see and hear what we hear, and we want them to also generate content that appeals to more than one of our senses.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article is part of\\nA guide to artificial intelligence in the enterprise \\n\\nWhich also includes:\\n10 top AI and machine learning trends for 2024\\n10 top artificial intelligence certifications and courses for 2024\\nThe future of AI: What to expect in the next 5 years\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe multimodal capabilities in OpenAI\\'s GPT-4 model enable the software to respond to visual and audio input. In his talk, Chen gave the example of taking photos of the inside of a fridge and asking ChatGPT to suggest a recipe based on the ingredients in the photo. The interaction could even encompass an audio element if using ChatGPT\\'s voice mode to pose the request aloud.\\n\\n\\n\\nOpenAI head of frontiers research Mark Chen addresses the audience at EmTech MIT.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlthough most generative AI initiatives today are text-based, \"the real power of these capabilities is going to be when you can marry up text and conversation with images and video, cross-pollinate all three of those, and apply those to a variety of businesses,\" said Matt Barrington, Americas emerging technologies leader at EY.\\nMultimodal AI\\'s real-world applications are diverse and expanding. In healthcare, for example, multimodal models can analyze medical images in light of patient history and genetic information to improve diagnostic accuracy. At the job function level, multimodal models can expand what various employees can do by extending basic design and coding capabilities to individuals without a formal background in those areas.\\n\"I can\\'t draw to save my life,\" Barrington said. \"Well, now I can. I\\'m decent with language, so ... I can plug into a capability like [image generation], and some of those ideas that were in my head that I could never physically draw, I can have AI do.\"\\nMoreover, introducing multimodal capabilities could strengthen models by offering them new data to learn from. \"As our models get better and better at modeling language and start to hit the limits of what they can learn from language, we want to provide the models with raw inputs from the world so that they can perceive the world on their own and draw their own inferences from things like video or audio data,\" Chen said.\\n\\n\\n2. Agentic AI\\nAgentic AI marks a significant shift from reactive to proactive AI. AI agents are advanced systems that exhibit autonomy, proactivity and the ability to act independently. Unlike traditional AI systems, which mainly respond to user inputs and follow predetermined programming, AI agents are designed to understand their environment, set goals and act to achieve those objectives without direct human intervention.\\nFor example, in environmental monitoring, an AI agent could be trained to collect data, analyze patterns and initiate preventive actions in response to hazards such as early signs of a forest fire. Likewise, a financial AI agent could actively manage an investment portfolio using adaptive strategies that react to changing market conditions in real time.\\n\"2023 was the year of being able to chat with an AI,\" wrote computer scientist Peter Norvig, a fellow at Stanford\\'s Human-Centered AI Institute, in a recent blog post. \"In 2024, we\\'ll see the ability for agents to get stuff done for you. Make reservations, plan a trip, connect to other services.\"\\nIn addition, combining agentic and multimodal AI could open up new possibilities. In the aforementioned presentation, Chen gave the example of an application designed to identify the contents of an uploaded image. Previously, someone looking to build such an application would have needed to train their own image recognition model and then figure out how to deploy it. But with multimodal, agentic models, this could all be accomplished through natural language prompting.\\n\"I really think that multimodal together with GPTs will open up the no-code development of computer vision applications, just in the same way that prompting opened up the no-code development of a lot of text-based applications,\" Chen said.\\n\\n\\n3. Open source AI\\nBuilding large language models and other powerful generative AI systems is an expensive process that requires enormous amounts of compute and data. But using an open source model enables developers to build on top of others\\' work, reducing costs and expanding AI access. Open source AI is publicly available, typically for free, enabling organizations and researchers to contribute to and build on existing code.\\nGitHub data from the past year shows a remarkable increase in developer engagement with AI, particularly generative AI. In 2023, generative AI projects entered the top 10 most popular projects across the code hosting platform for the first time, with projects such as Stable Diffusion and AutoGPT pulling in thousands of first-time contributors.\\nEarly in the year, open source generative models were limited in number, and their performance often lagged behind proprietary options such as ChatGPT. But the landscape broadened significantly over the course of 2023 to include powerful open source contenders such as Meta\\'s Llama 2 and Mistral AI\\'s Mixtral models. This could shift the dynamics of the AI landscape in 2024 by providing smaller, less resourced entities with access to sophisticated AI models and tools that were previously out of reach.\\n\"It gives everyone easy, fairly democratized access, and it\\'s great for experimentation and exploration,\" Barrington said.\\nOpen source approaches can also encourage transparency and ethical development, as more eyes on the code means a greater likelihood of identifying biases, bugs and security vulnerabilities. But experts have also expressed concerns about the misuse of open source AI to create disinformation and other harmful content. In addition, building and maintaining open source is difficult even for traditional software, let alone complex and compute-intensive AI models.\\n\\n\\n4. Retrieval-augmented generation\\nAlthough generative AI tools were widely adopted in 2023, they continue to be plagued by the problem of hallucinations: plausible-sounding but incorrect responses to users\\' queries. This limitation has presented a roadblock to enterprise adoption, where hallucinations in business-critical or customer-facing scenarios could be catastrophic. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a technique for reducing hallucinations, with potentially profound implications for enterprise AI adoption.\\nRAG blends text generation with information retrieval to enhance the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated content. It enables LLMs to access external information, helping them produce more accurate and contextually aware responses. Bypassing the need to store all knowledge directly in the LLM also reduces model size, which increases speed and lowers costs.\\n\"You can use RAG to go gather a ton of unstructured information, documents, etc., [and] feed it into a model without having to fine-tune or custom-train a model,\" Barrington said.\\nThese benefits are particularly enticing for enterprise applications where up-to-date factual knowledge is crucial. For example, businesses can use RAG with foundation models to create more efficient and informative chatbots and virtual assistants.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5. Customized enterprise generative AI models\\nMassive, general-purpose tools such as Midjourney and ChatGPT have attracted the most attention among consumers exploring generative AI. But for business use cases, smaller, narrow-purpose models could prove to have the most staying power, driven by the growing demand for AI systems that can meet niche requirements.\\nWhile creating a new model from scratch is a possibility, it\\'s a resource-intensive proposition that will be out of reach for many organizations. To build customized generative AI, most organizations instead modify existing AI models -- for example, tweaking their architecture or fine-tuning on a domain-specific data set. This can be cheaper than either building a new model from the ground up or relying on API calls to a public LLM.\\n\"Calls to GPT-4 as an API, just as an example, are very expensive, both in terms of cost and in terms of latency -- how long it can actually take to return a result,\" said Shane Luke, vice president of AI and machine learning at Workday. \"We are working a lot ... on optimizing so that we have the same capability, but it\\'s very targeted and specific. And so it can be a much smaller model that\\'s more manageable.\"\\nThe key advantage of customized generative AI models is their ability to cater to niche markets and user needs. Tailored generative AI tools can be built for almost any scenario, from customer support to supply chain management to document review. This is especially relevant for sectors with highly specialized terminology and practices, such as healthcare, finance and legal.\\nIn many business use cases, the most massive LLMs are overkill. Although ChatGPT might be the state of the art for a consumer-facing chatbot designed to handle any query, \"it\\'s not the state of the art for smaller enterprise applications,\" Luke said.\\nBarrington expects to see enterprises exploring a more diverse range of models in the coming year as AI developers\\' capabilities begin to converge. \"We\\'re expecting, over the next year or two, for there to be a much higher degree of parity across the models -- and that\\'s a good thing,\" he said.\\nOn a smaller scale, Luke has seen a similar scenario play out at Workday, which provides a set of AI services for teams to experiment with internally. Although employees started out using mostly OpenAI services, Luke said, he\\'s gradually seen a shift toward a mix of models from various providers, including Google and AWS.\\nBuilding a customized model rather than using an off-the-shelf public tool often also improves privacy and security, as it gives organizations greater control over their data. Luke gave the example of building a model for Workday tasks that involve handling sensitive personal data, such as disability status and health history. \"Those aren\\'t things that we\\'re going to want to send out to a third party,\" he said. \"Our customers generally wouldn\\'t be comfortable with that.\"\\nIn light of these privacy and security benefits, stricter AI regulation in the coming years could push organizations to focus their energies on proprietary models, explained Gillian Crossan, risk advisory principal and global technology sector leader at Deloitte.\\n\"It\\'s going to encourage enterprises to focus more on private models that are proprietary, that are domain-specific, rather than focus on these large language models that are trained with data from all over the internet and everything that that brings with it,\" she said.\\n\\n\\n6. Need for AI and machine learning talent\\nDesigning, training and testing a machine learning model is no easy feat -- much less pushing it to production and maintaining it in a complex organizational IT environment. It\\'s no surprise, then, that the growing need for AI and machine learning talent is expected to continue into 2024 and beyond.\\n\"The market is still really hot around talent,\" Luke said. \"It\\'s very easy to get a job in this space.\"\\nIn particular, as AI and machine learning become more integrated into business operations, there\\'s a growing need for professionals who can bridge the gap between theory and practice. This requires the ability to deploy, monitor and maintain AI systems in real-world settings -- a discipline often referred to as MLOps, short for machine learning operations.\\nIn a recent O\\'Reilly report, respondents cited AI programming, data analysis and statistics, and operations for AI and machine learning as the top three skills their organizations needed for generative AI projects. These types of skills, however, are in short supply. \"That\\'s going to be one of the challenges around AI -- to be able to have the talent readily available,\" Crossan said.\\nIn 2024, look for organizations to seek out talent with these types of skills -- and not just big tech companies. With IT and data nearly ubiquitous as business functions and AI initiatives rising in popularity, building internal AI and machine learning capabilities is poised to be the next stage in digital transformation.\\nCrossan also emphasized the importance of diversity in AI initiatives at every level, from technical teams building models up to the board. \"One of the big issues with AI and the public models is the amount of bias that exists in the training data,\" she said. \"And unless you have that diverse team within your organization that is challenging the results and challenging what you see, you are going to potentially end up in a worse place than you were before AI.\"\\n\\n\\n7. Shadow AI\\nAs employees across job functions become interested in generative AI, organizations are facing the issue of shadow AI: use of AI within an organization without explicit approval or oversight from the IT department. This trend is becoming increasingly prevalent as AI becomes more accessible, enabling even nontechnical workers to use it independently.\\nShadow AI typically arises when employees need quick solutions to a problem or want to explore new technology faster than official channels allow. This is especially common for easy-to-use AI chatbots, which employees can try out in their web browsers with little difficulty -- without going through IT review and approval processes.\\nOn the plus side, exploring ways to use these emerging technologies evinces a proactive, innovative spirit. But it also carries risk, since end users often lack relevant information on security, data privacy and compliance. For example, a user might feed trade secrets into a public-facing LLM without realizing that doing so exposes that sensitive information to third parties.\\n\"Once something gets out into these public models, you cannot pull it back,\" Barrington said. \"So there\\'s a bit of a fear factor and risk angle that\\'s appropriate for most enterprises, regardless of sector, to think through.\"\\n\\n\\n\\nShadow AI is just one facet of the larger phenomenon of shadow IT.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2024, organizations will need to take steps to manage shadow AI through governance frameworks that balance supporting innovation with protecting privacy and security. This could include setting clear acceptable AI use policies and providing approved platforms, as well as encouraging collaboration between IT and business leaders to understand how various departments want to use AI.\\n\"The reality is, everybody\\'s using it,\" Barrington said, in reference to recent EY research finding that 90% of respondents used AI at work. \"Whether you like it or not, your people are using it today, so you should figure out how to align them to ethical and responsible use of it.\"\\n\\n\\n8. A generative AI reality check\\nAs organizations progress from the initial excitement surrounding generative AI to actual adoption and integration, they\\'re likely to face a reality check in 2024 -- a phase often referred to as the \"trough of disillusionment\" in the Gartner Hype Cycle.\\n\"We\\'re definitely seeing a rapid shift from what we\\'ve been calling this experimentation phase into [asking], \\'How do I run this at scale across my enterprise?\\'\" Barrington said.\\nAs early enthusiasm begins to wane, organizations are confronting generative AI\\'s limitations, such as output quality, security and ethics concerns, and integration difficulties with existing systems and workflows. The complexity of implementing and scaling AI in a business environment is often underestimated, and tasks such as ensuring data quality, training models and maintaining AI systems in production can be more challenging than initially anticipated.\\n\"It\\'s actually not very easy to build a generative AI application and put it into production in a real product setting,\" Luke said.\\nThe silver lining is that these growing pains, while unpleasant in the short term, could result in a healthier, more tempered outlook in the long run. Moving past this phase will require setting realistic expectations for AI and developing a more nuanced understanding of what AI can and can\\'t do. AI projects should be clearly tied to business goals and practical use cases, with a clear plan in place for measuring outcomes.\\n\"If you have very loose use cases that are not clearly defined, that\\'s probably what\\'s going to hold you up the most,\" Crossan said.\\n\\n\\n9. Increased attention to AI ethics and security risks\\nThe proliferation of deepfakes and sophisticated AI-generated content is raising alarms about the potential for misinformation and manipulation in media and politics, as well as identity theft and other types of fraud. AI can also enhance the efficacy of ransomware and phishing attacks, making them more convincing, more adaptable and harder to detect.\\nAlthough efforts are underway to develop technologies for detecting AI-generated content, doing so remains challenging. Current AI watermarking techniques are relatively easy to circumvent, and existing AI detection software can be prone to false positives.\\nThe increasing ubiquity of AI systems also highlights the importance of ensuring that they are transparent and fair -- for example, by carefully vetting training data and algorithms for bias. Crossan emphasized that these ethics and compliance considerations should be interwoven throughout the process of developing an AI strategy.\\n\"You have to be thinking about, as an enterprise ... implementing AI, what are the controls that you\\'re going to need?\" she said. \"And that starts to help you plan a bit for the regulation so that you\\'re doing it together. You\\'re not doing all of this experimentation with AI and then [realizing], \\'Oh, now we need to think about the controls.\\' You do it at the same time.\"\\nSafety and ethics can also be another reason to look at smaller, more narrowly tailored models, Luke pointed out. \"These smaller, tuned, domain-specific models are just far less capable than the really big ones -- and we want that,\" he said. \"They\\'re less likely to be able to output something that you don\\'t want because they\\'re just not capable of as many things.\"\\n\\n\\n10. Evolving AI regulation\\nUnsurprisingly, given these ethics and security concerns, 2024 is shaping up to be a pivotal year for AI regulation, with laws, policies and industry frameworks rapidly evolving in the U.S. and globally. Organizations will need to stay informed and adaptable in the coming year, as shifting compliance requirements could have significant implications for global operations and AI development strategies.\\nThe EU\\'s AI Act, on which members of the EU\\'s Parliament and Council recently reached a provisional agreement, represents the world\\'s first comprehensive AI law. If adopted, it would ban certain uses of AI, impose obligations for developers of high-risk AI systems and require transparency from companies using generative AI, with noncompliance potentially resulting in multimillion-dollar fines. And it\\'s not just new legislation that could have an effect in 2024.\\n\"Interestingly enough, the regulatory issue that I see could have the biggest impact is GDPR -- good old-fashioned GDPR -- because of the need for rectification and erasure, the right to be forgotten, with public large language models,\" Crossan said. \"How do you control that when they\\'re learning from massive amounts of data, and how can you assure that you\\'ve been forgotten?\"\\nTogether with the GDPR, the AI Act could position the EU as a global AI regulator, potentially influencing AI use and development standards worldwide. \"They\\'re certainly ahead of where we are in the U.S. from an AI regulatory perspective,\" Crossan said.\\nThe U.S. doesn\\'t yet have comprehensive federal legislation comparable to the EU\\'s AI Act, but experts encourage organizations not to wait to think about compliance until formal requirements are in force. At EY, for example, \"we\\'re engaging with our clients to get ahead of it,\" Barrington said. Otherwise, businesses could find themselves playing catch-up when regulations do come into effect.\\nBeyond the ripple effects of European policy, recent activity in the U.S. executive branch also suggests how AI regulation could play out stateside. President Joe Biden\\'s October executive order implemented new mandates, such as requiring AI developers to share safety test results with the U.S. government and imposing restrictions to protect against the risks of AI in engineering dangerous biological materials. Various federal agencies have also issued guidance targeting specific sectors, such as NIST\\'s AI Risk Management Framework and the Federal Trade Commission\\'s statement warning businesses against making false claims about their products\\' AI use.\\nFurther complicating matters, 2024 is an election year in the U.S., and the current slate of presidential candidates shows a wide range of positions on tech policy questions. A new administration could theoretically change the executive branch\\'s approach to AI oversight through reversing or revising Biden\\'s executive order and nonbinding agency guidance.\\nLev Craig covers AI and machine learning as the site editor for TechTarget Enterprise AI.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Resources\\n\\n\\nDeloitte and AWS collaborate to enhance government contact centers with ...\\n–AWS\\n\\n\\nLessons Learned From Search to Generative Answering\\n–Coveo\\n\\n\\nGenerative AI Prompts Productivity, Imagination, And Innovation In The ...\\n–MicroStrategy\\n\\n\\nMoving AI from Innovation to Impact\\n–Red Hat\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDig Deeper on AI technologies\\n\\n\\n\\nGPT-4o vs. GPT-4: How do they compare?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy: Lev\\xa0Craig\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIBM moves ahead with open source, multi-model AI strategy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy: Shaun\\xa0Sutner\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGemini 1.5 Pro explained: Everything you need to know\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy: Sean\\xa0Kerner\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCloudinary developer lead: When (and when not) to use multi-modal LLMs for visual content\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy: Adrian\\xa0Bridgwater\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSponsored News\\n\\n\\nPower Your Generative AI Initiatives With High-Performance, Reliable, ...\\n–Dell Technologies and Intel\\n\\n\\nPrivate AI Demystified\\n–Equinix\\n\\n\\nSustainability, AI and Dell PowerEdge Servers\\n–Dell Technologies and Intel\\n\\nSee More\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Content\\n\\n\\nFossil\\'s experience building an internal AI image ...\\n– Enterprise AI\\n\\n\\nExplore real-world use cases for multimodal ...\\n– Enterprise AI\\n\\n\\nmultimodal AI\\n– Enterprise AI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest TechTarget resources\\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness Analytics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCIO\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nData Management\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nERP\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBusiness Analytics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEvaluate 8 of the top embedded analytics tools\\nSelecting the right embedded analytics tool for your organization can be difficult.

In this exploration, we'll begin with the fifth trend and work our way to the pinnacle.\\n\\n\\n5. Quantum AI\\nLeading our exploration at number 5 is Quantum AI. For those new to the concept, quantum computing might feel reminiscent of a sci-fi plotline. However, it's swiftly transitioning from the pages of fiction to the forefront of artificial intelligence research. Dive into the intricacies of qubits—quantum bits that can embody multiple states at once—and you'll grasp their revolutionary impact on data processing. It's not just about theoretical potential either; both emerging startups and established tech behemoths are channeling significant resources into developing quantum solutions. As 2024 unfolds, we will see monumental leaps in AI capabilities, especially in areas demanding complex problem-solving fueled by quantum advancements.\\n\\n4. AI Legislation\\nTransitioning to our fourth spotlight: AI legislation. AI's unprecedented trajectory isn't solely a fascination for tech enthusiasts—it's now commanding significant attention from global policymakers. As 2024 beckons, leading nations, including China, the EU, the U.S. and India, are diligently sculpting comprehensive AI policies. Their objectives are three-pronged: to catalyze technological breakthroughs, magnetize global investments, and concurrently safeguard their populace from any inadvertent AI repercussions. Conversations within the industry hint at potential international synergies, suggesting that global collaboration on AI benchmarks and norms could soon materialize.\\n\\n\\n3. Ethical AI\\nNavigating to our third focal point: Ethical AI. The expanding footprint of AI in our lives introduces a myriad of ethical dilemmas. As AI mechanisms increasingly inform decisions, spanning from health evaluations to financial counsel, it's imperative that they function with utmost transparency and fairness. However, the challenge extends beyond just engineering unbiased algorithms. We must cultivate rigorous standards to ensure both these systems and their architects remain answerable for their actions. As we approach 2024, experts foresee a blossoming interest in AI ethics education and a heightened prioritization of ethical considerations within AI research and development realms.\\n\\n2. Augmented Working\\nClaiming the penultimate position is Augmented Working. Envision AI as more than just an instrument; picture it as an invaluable ally. Imagine surgeons supplemented with AI-guided diagnostics during procedures, attorneys empowered by AI-curated case references mid-trial, or software developers aided by instantaneous, AI-propelled code suggestions. Additionally, as remote work and online education surge, AI stands poised to revolutionize tailored curriculum designs and optimize virtual team dynamics. 2024 heralds a symbiosis of human aptitude and AI prowess, amplifying both productivity and excellence.\\nMORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of 2024ByKevin PayneContributorBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of 2024ByCassidy HortonContributor\\n1. Next Generation of Generative AI\\nTaking the prime position on our list is the next generation of generative AI, advancing beyond the confines of simple chatbots and whimsical meme generators. We will see AI systems capable of weaving complex narratives, choreographing musical symphonies and potentially partnering in the creation of bestselling novels. A pivotal innovation in this space is multi-modal generative AI — systems adept at harmonizing various inputs like text, voice, melodies and visual cues. Picture an AI that, upon hearing a descriptive narration, can promptly draft a comprehensive article, render an illustrative image, set it to an apt musical backdrop and narrate it in multiple accents or languages. This integrative approach ushers in a myriad of opportunities, from multilayered content generation to riveting multisensory experiences. As we venture deeper into 2024, the delineation between human craftsmanship and AI-molded masterpieces will become ever more subtle, underscoring the need for discerning evaluation and genuine appreciation.\\n\\nAs we move through 2024, it teases a horizon enriched with AI innovations poised to reshape conventional boundaries. The five AI trends spotlighted here sketch the blueprint of an imminent future laden with untapped opportunities. Yet, while we navigate this transformative trajectory, it's vital to tread judiciously. In our pursuit of cutting-edge wonders, we must unwaveringly champion the core tenets of trust, fairness, accessibility and vigilant governance.\\n\\n \\n\\nYou can read more about future tech and business trends in my books, The Future Internet: How the Metaverse, Web 3.0, and Blockchain Will Transform Business and Society, Future Skills: The 20 Skills And Competencies Everyone Needs To Succeed In A Digital World and Business Trends in Practice, which won the 2022 Business Book of the Year award.

A small group of high performers lead the way.\\n\\n (23 pages)\\nIf 2023 was the year the world discovered generative AI (gen AI), 2024 is the year organizations truly began using—and deriving business value from—this new technology. In the latest McKinsey Global Survey\\xa0on AI, 65 percent of respondents report that their organizations are regularly using gen AI, nearly double the percentage from our previous survey just ten months ago. Respondents’ expectations for gen AI’s impact remain as high as they were last year, with three-quarters predicting that gen AI will lead to significant or disruptive change in their industries in the years ahead.\\n About the authorsThis article is a collaborative effort by Alex Singla, Alexander Sukharevsky, Lareina Yee, and Michael Chui, with Bryce Hall, representing views from QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and McKinsey Digital.\\nOrganizations are already seeing material benefits from gen AI use, reporting both cost decreases and revenue jumps in the business units deploying the technology. The survey also provides insights into the kinds of risks presented by gen AI—most notably, inaccuracy—as well as the emerging practices of top performers to mitigate those challenges and capture value.\\nAI adoption surges\\nInterest in generative AI has also brightened the spotlight on a broader set of AI capabilities. For the past six years, AI adoption by respondents’ organizations has hovered at about 50 percent. This year, the survey finds that adoption has jumped to 72 percent (Exhibit 1). And the interest is truly global in scope. Our 2023 survey found that AI adoption did not reach 66 percent in any region; however, this year more than two-thirds of respondents in nearly every region say their organizations are using AI.1Organizations based in Central and South America are the exception, with 58 percent of respondents working for organizations based in Central and South America reporting AI adoption. Looking by industry, the biggest increase in adoption can be found in professional services.2Includes respondents working for organizations focused on human resources, legal services, management consulting, market research, R&D, tax preparation, and training.\\n 1\\nAlso, responses suggest that companies are now using AI in more parts of the business. Half of respondents say their organizations have adopted AI in two or more business functions, up from less than a third of respondents in 2023 (Exhibit 2).\\n 2\\nGen AI adoption is most common in the functions where it can create the most value\\nMost respondents now report that their organizations—and they as individuals—are using gen AI. Sixty-five percent of respondents say their organizations are regularly using gen AI in at least one business function, up from one-third last year. The average organization using gen AI is doing so in two functions, most often in marketing and sales and in product and service development—two functions in which previous research\\xa0determined that gen AI adoption could generate the most value3“The economic potential of generative AI: The next productivity frontier,” McKinsey, June 14, 2023.—as well as in IT (Exhibit 3). The biggest increase from 2023 is found in marketing and sales, where reported adoption has more than doubled. Yet across functions, only two use cases, both within marketing and sales, are reported by 15 percent or more of respondents.\\n 3\\nGen AI also is weaving its way into respondents’ personal lives. Compared with 2023, respondents are much more likely to be using gen AI at work and even more likely to be using gen AI both at work and in their personal lives (Exhibit 4). The survey finds upticks in gen AI use across all regions, with the largest increases in Asia–Pacific and Greater China. Respondents at the highest seniority levels, meanwhile, show larger jumps in the use of gen Al tools for work and outside of work compared with their midlevel-management peers. Looking at specific industries, respondents working in energy and materials and in professional services report the largest increase in gen AI use.\\n\\nInvestments in gen AI and analytical AI are beginning to create value\\nThe latest survey also shows how different industries are budgeting for gen AI. Responses suggest that, in many industries, organizations are about equally as likely to be investing more than 5 percent of their digital budgets in gen AI as they are in nongenerative, analytical-AI solutions (Exhibit 5). Yet in most industries, larger shares of respondents report that their organizations spend more than 20 percent on analytical AI than on gen AI. Looking ahead, most respondents—67 percent—expect their organizations to invest more in AI over the next three years.\\n\\nWhere are those investments paying off? For the first time, our latest survey explored the value created by gen AI use by business function. The function in which the largest share of respondents report seeing cost decreases is human resources. Respondents most commonly report meaningful revenue increases (of more than 5 percent) in supply chain and inventory management (Exhibit 6). For analytical AI, respondents most often report seeing cost benefits in service operations—in line with what we found last year—as well as meaningful revenue increases from AI use in marketing and sales.\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\\nInaccuracy: The most recognized and experienced risk of gen AI use\\nAs businesses begin to see the benefits of gen AI, they’re also recognizing the diverse risks associated with the technology. These can range from data management risks such as data privacy, bias, or intellectual property (IP) infringement to model management risks, which tend to focus on inaccurate output or lack of explainability. A third big risk category is security and incorrect use.\\nRespondents to the latest survey are more likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider inaccuracy and IP infringement to be relevant to their use of gen AI, and about half continue to view cybersecurity as a risk (Exhibit 7).Conversely, respondents are less likely than they were last year to say their organizations consider workforce and labor displacement to be relevant risks and are not increasing efforts to mitigate them.In fact, inaccuracy—which can affect use cases across the gen AI value chain, ranging from customer journeys and summarization to coding and creative content—is the only risk that respondents are significantly more likely than last year to say their organizations are actively working to mitigate.Exhibit 7 \\nSome organizations have already experienced negative consequences from the use of gen AI, with 44 percent of respondents saying their organizations have experienced at least one consequence (Exhibit 8). Respondents most often report inaccuracy as a risk that has affected their organizations, followed by cybersecurity and explainability.\\n 8\\nOur previous research has found that there are several elements of governance that can help in scaling gen AI use responsibly, yet few respondents report having these risk-related practices in place.4“Implementing generative AI with speed and safety,” McKinsey Quarterly, March 13, 2024. For example, just 18 percent say their organizations have an enterprise-wide council or board with the authority to make decisions involving responsible AI governance, and only one-third say gen AI risk awareness and risk mitigation controls are required skill sets for technical talent.\\n\\n\\xa0\\nBringing gen AI capabilities to bear\\nThe latest survey also sought to understand how, and how quickly, organizations are deploying these new gen AI tools. We have found three archetypes for implementing gen AI solutions: takers use off-the-shelf, publicly available solutions; shapers customize those tools with proprietary data and systems; and makers develop their own foundation models from scratch.5“Technology’s generational moment with generative AI: A CIO and CTO guide,” McKinsey, July 11, 2023. Across most industries, the survey results suggest that organizations are finding off-the-shelf offerings applicable to their business needs—though many are pursuing opportunities to customize models or even develop their own (Exhibit 9). About half of reported gen AI uses within respondents’ business functions are utilizing off-the-shelf, publicly available models or tools, with little or no customization. Respondents in energy and materials, technology, and media and telecommunications are more likely to report significant customization or tuning of publicly available models or developing their own proprietary models to address specific business needs.\\n 9\\n\\nRespondents most often report that their organizations required one to four months from the start of a project to put gen AI into production, though the time it takes varies by business function (Exhibit 10). It also depends upon the approach for acquiring those capabilities. Not surprisingly, reported uses of highly customized or proprietary models are 1.5 times more likely than off-the-shelf, publicly available models to take five months or more to implement.\\n 10\\n\\n\\xa0\\nGen AI high performers are excelling despite facing challenges\\nGen AI is a new technology, and organizations are still early in the journey of pursuing its opportunities and scaling it across functions. So it’s little surprise that only a small subset of respondents (46 out of 876) report that a meaningful share of their organizations’ EBIT can be attributed to their deployment of gen AI. Still, these gen AI leaders are worth examining closely. These, after all, are the early movers, who already attribute more than 10 percent of their organizations’ EBIT to their use of gen AI. Forty-two percent of these high performers say more than 20 percent of their EBIT is attributable to their use of nongenerative, analytical AI, and they span industries and regions—though most are at organizations with less than $1 billion in annual revenue. The AI-related practices at these organizations can offer guidance to those looking to create value from gen AI adoption at their own organizations.\\nTo start, gen AI high performers are using gen AI in more business functions—an average of three functions, while others average two. They, like other organizations, are most likely to use gen AI in marketing and sales and product or service development, but they’re much more likely than others to use gen AI solutions in risk, legal, and compliance; in strategy and corporate finance; and in supply chain and inventory management. They’re more than three times as likely as others to be using gen AI in activities ranging from processing of accounting documents and risk assessment to R&D testing and pricing and promotions. While, overall, about half of reported gen AI applications within business functions are utilizing publicly available models or tools, gen AI high performers are less likely to use those off-the-shelf options than to either implement significantly customized versions of those tools or to develop their own proprietary foundation models.\\nWhat else are these high performers doing differently? For one thing, they are paying more attention to gen-AI-related risks. Perhaps because they are further along on their journeys, they are more likely than others to say their organizations have experienced every negative consequence from gen AI we asked about, from cybersecurity and personal privacy to explainability and IP infringement. Given that, they are more likely than others to report that their organizations consider those risks, as well as regulatory compliance, environmental impacts, and political stability, to be relevant to their gen AI use, and they say they take steps to mitigate more risks than others do.\\nGen AI high performers are also much more likely to say their organizations follow a set of risk-related best practices (Exhibit 11). For example, they are nearly twice as likely as others to involve the legal function and embed risk reviews early on in the development of gen AI solutions—that is, to “shift left.” They’re also much more likely than others to employ a wide range of other best practices, from strategy-related practices to those related to scaling.\\n\\nIn addition to experiencing the risks of gen AI adoption, high performers have encountered other challenges that can serve as warnings to others (Exhibit 12). Seventy percent say they have experienced difficulties with data, including defining processes for data governance, developing the ability to quickly integrate data into AI models, and an insufficient amount of training data, highlighting the essential role that data play in capturing value. High performers are also more likely than others to report experiencing challenges with their operating models, such as implementing agile ways of working and effective sprint performance management.\\n 12\\n\\n\\xa0\\nAbout the research\\nThe online survey was in the field from February 22 to March 5, 2024, and garnered responses from 1,363 participants representing the full range of regions, industries, company sizes, functional specialties, and tenures. Of those respondents, 981 said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one business function, and 878 said their organizations were regularly using gen AI in at least one function. To adjust for differences in response rates, the data are weighted by the contribution of each respondent’s nation to global GDP.\\n\\xa0Alex Singla and Alexander Sukharevsky\\xa0are global coleaders of QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey, and senior partners in McKinsey’s Chicago and London offices, respectively; Lareina Yee\\xa0is a senior partner in the Bay Area office, where Michael Chui, a McKinsey Global Institute partner, is a partner; and Bryce Hall\\xa0is an associate partner in the Washington, DC, office.\\nThey wish to thank Kaitlin Noe, Larry Kanter, Mallika Jhamb, and Shinjini Srivastava for their contributions to this work.\\n\\nThis article was edited by Heather Hanselman, a senior editor in McKinsey’s Atlanta office.Explore a career with usSearch OpeningsRelated ArticlesArticleMoving past gen AI’s honeymoon phase: Seven hard truths for CIOs to get from pilot to scaleArticle - McKinsey QuarterlyA generative AI reset: Rewiring to turn potential into value in 2024Article - McKinsey QuarterlyImplementing generative AI with speed and safety')],\n",

You can read the rest of our series here. This time last year we did something reckless. In an industry where nothing stands still, we had a go at predicting the future.\\xa0  How did we do? Our four big bets for 2023 were that the next big thing in chatbots would be multimodal (check: the most powerful large language models out there, OpenAI’s GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, work with text, images and audio); that policymakers would draw up tough new regulations (check: Biden’s executive order came out in October and the European Union’s AI Act was finally agreed in December); Big Tech would feel pressure from open-source startups (half right: the open-source boom continues, but AI companies like OpenAI and Google DeepMind still stole the limelight); and that AI would change big pharma for good (too soon to tell: the AI revolution in drug discovery is in full swing, but the first drugs developed using AI are still some years from market). Now we’re doing it again. \\nRelated StoryHow Meta and AI companies recruited striking actors to train AIHollywood actors are on strike over concerns about the use of AI, but for as little as $300, Meta and a company called Realeyes hired them to make avatars appear more human.\\n We decided to ignore the obvious. We know that large language models will continue to dominate. Regulators will grow bolder. AI’s problems—from bias to copyright to doomerism—will shape the agenda for researchers, regulators, and the public, not just in 2024 but for years to come. (Read more about our six big questions for generative AI here.) Instead, we’ve picked a few more specific trends. Here’s what to watch out for in 2024. (Come back next year and check how we did.) \\n 1 Customized chatbots You get a chatbot! And you get a chatbot! In 2024, tech companies that invested heavily in generative AI will be under pressure to prove that they can make money off their products. To do this, AI giants Google and OpenAI are betting big on going small: both are developing user-friendly platforms that allow people to customize powerful language models and make their own mini chatbots that cater to their specific needs—no coding skills required. Both have launched web-based tools that allow anyone to become a generative-AI app developer.\\xa0 In 2024, generative AI might actually become useful for the regular, non-tech person, and we are going to see more people tinkering with a million little AI models. State-of-the-art AI models, such as GPT-4 and Gemini, are multimodal, meaning they can process not only text but images and even videos. This new capability could unlock a whole bunch of new apps. For example, a real estate agent can upload text from previous listings, fine-tune a powerful model to generate similar text with just a click of a button, upload videos and photos of new listings, and simply ask the customized AI to generate a description of the property.\\xa0 But of course, the success of this plan hinges on whether these models work reliably. Language models often make stuff up, and generative models are riddled with biases. They are also easy to hack, especially if they are allowed to browse the web. Tech companies have not solved any of these problems. When the novelty wears off, they’ll have to offer their customers ways to deal with these problems.\\xa0 —Melissa Heikkilä    STEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ENVATO   2 Generative AI’s second wave will be video It’s amazing how fast the fantastic becomes familiar. The first generative models to produce photorealistic images exploded into the mainstream in 2022—and soon became commonplace. Tools like OpenAI’s DALL-E, Stability AI’s Stable Diffusion, and Adobe’s Firefly flooded the internet with jaw-dropping images of everything from the pope in Balenciaga to prize-winning art. But it’s not all good fun: for every pug waving pompoms, there’s another piece of knock-off fantasy art or sexist sexual stereotyping. The new frontier is text-to-video. Expect it to take everything that was good, bad, or ugly about text-to-image and supersize it. A year ago we got the first glimpse of what generative models could do when they were trained to stitch together multiple still images into clips a few seconds long. The results were distorted and jerky. But the tech has rapidly improved. Runway, a startup that makes generative video models (and the company that co-created Stable Diffusion), is dropping new versions of its tools every few months. Its latest model, called Gen-2, still generates video just a few seconds long, but the quality is striking. The best clips aren’t far off what Pixar might put out. \\n\\nRunway has set up an annual AI film festival that showcases experimental movies made with a range of AI tools. This year’s festival has a $60,000 prize pot, and the 10 best films will be screened in New York and Los Angeles. It’s no surprise that top studios are taking notice. Movie giants, including Paramount and Disney, are now exploring the use of generative AI throughout their production pipeline. The tech is being used to lip-sync actors’ performances to multiple foreign-language overdubs. And it is reinventing what’s possible with special effects. In 2023, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny starred a de-aged deepfake Harrison Ford. This is just the start.\\xa0\\xa0 Away from the big screen, deepfake tech for marketing or training purposes is taking off too. For example, UK-based Synthesia makes tools that can turn a one-off performance by an actor into an endless stream of deepfake avatars, reciting whatever script you give them at the push of a button. According to the company, its tech is now used by 44% of Fortune 100 companies.\\xa0 The ability to do so much with so little raises serious questions for actors. Concerns about studios’ use and misuse of AI were at the heart of the SAG-AFTRA strikes last year. But the true impact of the tech is only just becoming apparent. “The craft of filmmaking is fundamentally changing,” says Souki Mehdaoui, an independent filmmaker and cofounder of Bell & Whistle, a consultancy specializing in creative technologies.  —Will Douglas Heaven  3 AI-generated election disinformation will be everywhere\\xa0 If recent elections are anything to go by, AI-generated election disinformation and deepfakes are going to be a huge problem as a record number of people march to the polls in 2024. We’re already seeing politicians weaponizing these tools. In Argentina, two presidential candidates created AI-generated images and videos of their opponents to attack them. In Slovakia, deepfakes of a liberal pro-European party leader threatening to raise the price of beer and making jokes about child pornography spread like wildfire during the country’s elections. And in the US, Donald Trump has cheered on a group that uses AI to generate memes with racist and sexist tropes.\\xa0 Related StoryLooking back to look forwardThis magazine's 125 years of history is fascinating—but only if we use it to help us understand where technology is headed next.\\n While it’s hard to say how much these examples have influenced the outcomes of elections, their proliferation is a worrying trend. It will become harder than ever to recognize what is real online. In an already inflamed and polarized political climate, this could have severe consequences. Just a few years ago creating a deepfake would have required advanced technical skills, but generative AI has made it stupidly easy and accessible, and the outputs are looking increasingly realistic. Even reputable sources might be fooled by AI-generated content. For example, users-submitted AI-generated images purporting to depict the Israel-Gaza crisis have flooded stock image marketplaces like Adobe’s.\\xa0 \\nThe coming year will be pivotal for those fighting against the proliferation of such content. Techniques to track and mitigate it content are still in early days of development. Watermarks, such as Google DeepMind’s SynthID, are still mostly voluntary and not completely foolproof. And social media platforms are notoriously slow in taking down misinformation. Get ready for a massive real-time experiment in busting AI-generated fake news.\\xa0 —Melissa Heikkilä \\n  STEPHANIE ARNETT/MITTR | ISTOCK, ENVATO   4 Robots that multitask Inspired by some of the core techniques behind generative AI’s current boom, roboticists are starting to build more general-purpose robots that can do a wider range of tasks. The last few years in AI have seen a shift away from using multiple small models, each trained to do different tasks—identifying images, drawing them, captioning them—toward single, monolithic models trained to do all these things and more. By showing OpenAI’s GPT-3 a few additional examples (known as fine-tuning), researchers can train it to solve coding problems, write movie scripts, pass high school biology exams, and so on. Multimodal models, like GPT-4 and Google DeepMind’s Gemini, can solve visual tasks as well as linguistic ones. The same approach can work for robots, so it wouldn’t be necessary to train one to flip pancakes and another to open doors: a one-size-fits-all model could give robots the ability to multitask. Several examples of work in this area emerged in 2023. In June, DeepMind released Robocat (an update on last year’s Gato), which generates its own data from trial and error to learn how to control many different robot arms (instead of one specific arm, which is more typical).\\xa0 In October, the company put out yet another general-purpose model for robots, called RT-X, and a big new general-purpose training data set, in collaboration with 33 university labs. Other top research teams, such as RAIL (Robotic Artificial Intelligence and Learning) at the University of California, Berkeley, are looking at similar tech. The problem is a lack of data. Generative AI draws on an internet-size data set of text and images. In comparison, robots have very few good sources of data to help them learn how to do many of the industrial or domestic tasks we want them to. \\nLerrel Pinto at New York University leads one team addressing that. He and his colleagues are developing techniques that let robots learn by trial and error, coming up with their own training data as they go. In an even more low-key project, Pinto has recruited volunteers to collect video data from around their homes using an iPhone camera mounted to a trash picker. Big companies have also started to release large data sets for training robots in the last couple of years, such as Meta’s Ego4D. This approach is already showing promise in driverless cars. Startups such as Wayve, Waabi, and Ghost are pioneering a new wave of self-driving AI that uses a single large model to control a vehicle rather than multiple smaller models to control specific driving tasks. This has let small companies catch up with giants like Cruise and Waymo. Wayve is now testing its driverless cars on the narrow, busy streets of London. Robots everywhere are set to get a similar boost. —Will Douglas Heaven hideby Melissa Heikkilä & Will Douglas HeavenShareShare story on linkedinShare story on twitterShare story on facebookShare story on emailPopularHappy birthday, baby!

The 2024 Index is our most comprehensive to date and arrives at an important moment when AI’s influence on society has never been more pronounced. This year, we have broadened our scope to more extensively cover essential trends such as technical advancements in AI, public perceptions of the technology, and the geopolitical dynamics surrounding its development. Featuring more original data than ever before, this edition introduces new estimates on AI training costs, detailed analyses of the responsible AI landscape, and an entirely new chapter dedicated to AI’s impact on science and medicine.The AI Index report tracks, collates, distills, and visualizes data related to artificial intelligence (AI). Our mission is to provide unbiased, rigorously vetted, broadly sourced data in order for policymakers, researchers, executives, journalists, and the general public to develop a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the complex field of AI.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTOP TAKEAWAYS\\n\\n\\n1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all.AI has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning.\\n\\n\\n2. Industry continues to dominate frontier AI research.\\xa0In 2023, industry produced 51 notable machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. There were also 21 notable models resulting from industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high.\\n\\n\\n3. Frontier models get way more expensive.According to AI Index estimates, the training costs of state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 used an estimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while Google’s Gemini Ultra cost $191 million for compute.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4. The United States leads China, the EU, and the U.K. as the leading source of top AI models.\\xa0In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European Union’s 21 and China’s 15.\\n\\n\\n5. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking.New research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting. Leading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different responsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top AI models.\\n\\n\\n6. Generative AI investment skyrockets.Despite a decline in overall AI private investment last year, funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in the generative AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n7. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work.In 2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still other studies caution that using AI without proper oversight can lead to diminished performance.\\n\\n\\n8. Scientific progress accelerates even further, thanks to AI.In 2022, AI began to advance scientific discovery. 2023, however, saw the launch of even more significant science-related AI applications—from AlphaDev, which makes algorithmic sorting more efficient, to GNoME, which facilitates the process of materials discovery.\\n\\n\\n9. The number of AI regulations in the United States sharply increases.The number of AI-related regulations in the U.S. has risen significantly in the past year and over the last five years. In 2023, there were 25 AI-related regulations, up from just one in 2016. Last year alone, the total number of AI-related regulations grew by 56.3%.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n10. People across the globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous.A survey from Ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think AI will dramatically affect their lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness toward AI products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests that 52% of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, rising from 38% in 2022.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCHAPTERS\\nChapter 1: Research and Development\\nThis chapter studies trends in AI research and development. It begins by examining trends in AI publications and patents, and then examines trends in notable AI systems and foundation models. It concludes by analyzing AI conference attendance and open-source AI software projects.\\n\\nDOWNLOAD CHAPTER 1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                1.

Open-source AI research explodes.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                8. The number of AI publications continues to rise.            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2023, industry produced 51 notable machine learning models, while academia contributed only 15. There were also 21 notable models resulting from industry-academia collaborations in 2023, a new high.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2023, a total of 149 foundation models were released, more than double the amount released in 2022. Of these newly released models, 65.7% were open-source, compared to only 44.4% in 2022 and 33.3% in 2021.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to AI Index estimates, the training costs of state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels. For example, OpenAI’s GPT-4 used an estimated $78 million worth of compute to train, while Google’s Gemini Ultra cost $191 million for compute.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n In 2023, 61 notable AI models originated from U.S.-based institutions, far outpacing the European Union’s 21 and China’s 15.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom 2021 to 2022, AI patent grants worldwide increased sharply by 62.7%. Since 2010, the number of granted AI patents has increased more than 31 times.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2022, China led global AI patent origins with 61.1%, significantly outpacing the United States, which accounted for 20.9% of AI patent origins. Since 2010, the U.S. share of AI patents has decreased from 54.1%.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince 2011, the number of AI-related projects on GitHub has seen a consistent increase, growing from 845 in 2011 to approximately 1.8 million in 2023. Notably, there was a sharp 59.3% rise in the total number of GitHub AI projects in 2023 alone. The total number of stars for AI-related projects on GitHub also significantly increased in 2023, more than tripling from 4.0 million in 2022 to 12.2 million.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nBetween 2010 and 2022, the total number of AI publications nearly tripled, rising from approximately 88,000 in 2010 to more than 240,000 in 2022. The increase over the last year was a modest 1.1%.        \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 2: Technical Performance\\nThe technical performance section of this year’s AI Index offers a comprehensive overview of AI advancements in 2023. It starts with a high-level overview of AI technical performance, tracing its broad evolution over time. The chapter then examines the current state of a wide range of AI capabilities, including language processing, coding, computer vision (image and video analysis), reasoning, audio processing, autonomous agents, robotics, and reinforcement learning. It also shines a spotlight on notable AI research breakthroughs from the past year, exploring methods for improving LLMs through prompting, optimization, and fine-tuning, and wraps up with an exploration of AI systems’ environmental footprint.\\n\\nDOWNLOAD CHAPTER 2\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                1. AI beats humans on some tasks, but not on all.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                2. Here comes multimodal AI.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                3. Harder benchmarks emerge.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                4. Better AI means better data which means … even better AI.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                5. Human evaluation is in.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                6. Thanks to LLMs, robots have become more flexible.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                7. More technical research in agentic AI.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                8. Closed LLMs significantly outperform open ones.            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAI has surpassed human performance on several benchmarks, including some in image classification, visual reasoning, and English understanding. Yet it trails behind on more complex tasks like competition-level mathematics, visual commonsense reasoning and planning.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nTraditionally AI systems have been limited in scope, with language models excelling in text comprehension but faltering in image processing, and vice versa. However, recent advancements have led to the development of strong multimodal models, such as Google’s Gemini and OpenAI’s GPT-4. These models demonstrate flexibility and are capable of handling images and text and, in some instances, can even process audio.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAI models have reached performance saturation on established benchmarks such as ImageNet, SQuAD, and SuperGLUE, prompting researchers to develop more challenging ones. In 2023, several challenging new benchmarks emerged, including SWE-bench for coding, HEIM for image generation, MMMU for general reasoning, MoCa for moral reasoning, AgentBench for agent-based behavior, and HaluEval for hallucinations.          \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNew AI models such as SegmentAnything and Skoltech are being used to generate specialized data for tasks like image segmentation and 3D reconstruction. Data is vital for AI technical improvements. The use of AI to create more data enhances current capabilities and paves the way for future algorithmic improvements, especially on harder tasks.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWith generative models producing high-quality text, images, and more, benchmarking has slowly started shifting toward incorporating human evaluations like the Chatbot Arena Leaderboard rather than computerized rankings like ImageNet or SQuAD. Public feeling about AI is becoming an increasingly important consideration in tracking AI progress.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe fusion of language modeling with robotics has given rise to more flexible robotic systems like PaLM-E and RT-2. Beyond their improved robotic capabilities, these models can ask questions, which marks a significant step toward robots that can interact more effectively with the real world.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nCreating AI agents, systems capable of autonomous operation in specific environments, has long challenged computer scientists. However, emerging research suggests that the performance of autonomous AI agents is improving. Current agents can now master complex games like Minecraft and effectively tackle real-world tasks, such as online shopping and research assistance.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOn 10 select AI benchmarks, closed models outperformed open ones, with a median performance advantage of 24.2%. Differences in the performance of closed and open models carry important implications for AI policy debates.        \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 3: Responsible AI\\nAI is increasingly woven into nearly every facet of our lives. This integration is occurring in sectors such as education, finance, and healthcare, where critical decisions are often based on algorithmic insights. This trend promises to bring many advantages; however, it also introduces potential risks. Consequently, in the past year, there has been a significant focus on the responsible development and deployment of AI systems. The AI community has also become more concerned with assessing the impact of AI systems and mitigating risks for those affected.This chapter explores key trends in responsible AI by examining metrics, research, and benchmarks in four key responsible AI areas: privacy and data governance, transparency and explainability, security and safety, and fairness. Given that 4 billion people are expected to vote globally in 2024, this chapter also features a special section on AI and elections and more broadly explores the potential impact of AI on political processes.\\n\\nDOWNLOAD CHAPTER 3\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                1. Robust and standardized evaluations for LLM responsibility are seriously lacking.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                2. Political deepfakes are easy to generate and difficult to detect.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                3. Researchers discover more complex vulnerabilities in LLMs.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                4. Risks from AI are a concern for businesses across the globe.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                5.  LLMs can output copyrighted material.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                6. AI developers score low on transparency, with consequences for research.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                7. Extreme AI risks are difficult to analyze.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                8. The number of AI incidents continues to rise.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                9. ChatGPT is politically biased.            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nNew research from the AI Index reveals a significant lack of standardization in responsible AI reporting. Leading developers, including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, primarily test their models against different responsible AI benchmarks. This practice complicates efforts to systematically compare the risks and limitations of top AI models.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPolitical deepfakes are already affecting elections across the world, with recent research suggesting that existing AI deepfake detection methods perform with varying levels of accuracy. In addition, new projects like CounterCloud demonstrate how easily AI can create and disseminate fake content.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nPreviously, most efforts to red team AI models focused on testing adversarial prompts that intuitively made sense to humans. This year, researchers found less obvious strategies to get LLMs to exhibit harmful behavior, like asking the models to infinitely repeat random words.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA global survey on responsible AI highlights that companies’ top AI-related concerns include privacy, security, and reliability. The survey shows that organizations are beginning to take steps to mitigate these risks. However, globally, most companies have so far only mitigated a portion of these risks.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMultiple researchers have shown that the generative outputs of popular LLMs may contain copyrighted material, such as excerpts from The New York Times or scenes from movies. Whether such output constitutes copyright violations is becoming a central legal question.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe newly introduced Foundation Model Transparency Index shows that AI developers lack transparency, especially regarding the disclosure of training data and methodologies. This lack of openness hinders efforts to further understand the robustness and safety of AI systems.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the past year, a substantial debate has emerged among AI scholars and practitioners regarding the focus on immediate model risks, like algorithmic discrimination, versus potential long-term existential threats. It has become challenging to distinguish which claims are scientifically founded and should inform policymaking. This difficulty is compounded by the tangible nature of already present short-term risks in contrast with the theoretical nature of existential threats.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAccording to the AI Incident Database, which tracks incidents related to the misuse of AI, 123 incidents were reported in 2023, a 32.3% increase from 2022. Since 2013, AI incidents have grown by over twentyfold. A notable example includes AI-generated, sexually explicit deepfakes of Taylor Swift that were widely shared online.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nResearchers find a significant bias in ChatGPT toward Democrats in the United States and the Labour Party in the U.K. This finding raises concerns about the tool’s potential to influence users’ political views, particularly in a year marked by major global elections.        \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 4: Economy\\nThe integration of AI into the economy raises many compelling questions. Some predict that AI will drive productivity improvements, but the extent of its impact remains uncertain. A major concern is the potential for massive labor displacement—to what degree will jobs be automated versus augmented by AI? Companies are already utilizing AI in various ways across industries, but some regions of the world are witnessing greater investment inflows into this transformative technology. Moreover, investor interest appears to be gravitating toward specific AI subfields like natural language processing and data management.This chapter examines AI-related economic trends using data from Lightcast, LinkedIn, Quid, McKinsey, Stack Overflow, and the International Federation of Robotics (IFR). It begins by analyzing AI-related occupations, covering labor demand, hiring trends, skill penetration, and talent availability. The chapter then explores corporate investment in AI, introducing a new section focused specifically on generative AI. It further examines corporate adoption of AI, assessing current usage and how developers adopt these technologies. Finally, it assesses AI’s current and projected economic impact and robot installations across various sectors.\\n\\nDOWNLOAD CHAPTER 4\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                1. Generative AI investment skyrockets.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                2. Already a leader, the United States pulls even further ahead in AI private investment.             \\n\\n\\n\\n                3. Fewer AI jobs, in the United States and across the globe.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                4. AI decreases costs and increases revenues.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                5. Total AI private investment declines again, while the number of newly funded AI companies increases.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                6. AI organizational adoption ticks up.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                7. China dominates industrial robotics.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                8. Greater diversity in robot installations.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                9. The data is in: AI makes workers more productive and leads to higher quality work.             \\n\\n\\n\\n                10. Fortune 500 companies start talking a lot about AI, especially generative AI.            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nDespite a decline in overall AI private investment last year, funding for generative AI surged, nearly octupling from 2022 to reach $25.2 billion. Major players in the generative AI space, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, and Inflection, reported substantial fundraising rounds.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2023, the United States saw AI investments reach $67.2 billion, nearly 8.7 times more than China, the next highest investor. While private AI investment in China and the European Union, including the United Kingdom, declined by 44.2% and 14.1%, respectively, since 2022, the United States experienced a notable increase of 22.1% in the same time frame.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2022, AI-related positions made up 2.0% of all job postings in America, a figure that decreased to 1.6% in 2023. This decline in AI job listings is attributed to fewer postings from leading AI firms and a reduced proportion of tech roles within these companies.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n A new McKinsey survey reveals that 42% of surveyed organizations report cost reductions from implementing AI (including generative AI), and 59% report revenue increases. Compared to the previous year, there was a 10 percentage point increase in respondents reporting decreased costs, suggesting AI is driving significant business efficiency gains.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nGlobal private AI investment has fallen for the second year in a row, though less than the sharp decrease from 2021 to 2022. The count of newly funded AI companies spiked to 1,812, up 40.6% from the previous year.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA 2023 McKinsey report reveals that 55% of organizations now use AI (including generative AI) in at least one business unit or function, up from 50% in 2022 and 20% in 2017.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSince surpassing Japan in 2013 as the leading installer of industrial robots, China has significantly widened the gap with the nearest competitor nation. In 2013, China’s installations accounted for 20.8% of the global total, a share that rose to 52.4% by 2022.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2017, collaborative robots represented a mere 2.8% of all new industrial robot installations, a figure that climbed to 9.9% by 2022. Similarly, 2022 saw a rise in service robot installations across all application categories, except for medical robotics. This trend indicates not just an overall increase in robot installations but also a growing emphasis on deploying robots for human-facing roles.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2023, several studies assessed AI’s impact on labor, suggesting that AI enables workers to complete tasks more quickly and to improve the quality of their output. These studies also demonstrated AI’s potential to bridge the skill gap between low- and high-skilled workers. Still other studies caution that using AI without proper oversight can lead to diminished performance.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2023, AI was mentioned in 394 earnings calls (nearly 80% of all Fortune 500 companies), a notable increase from 266 mentions in 2022. Since 2018, mentions of AI in Fortune 500 earnings calls have nearly doubled. The most frequently cited theme, appearing in 19.7% of all earnings calls, was generative AI.        \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 5: Science and Medicine\\nThis year’s AI Index introduces a new chapter on AI in science and medicine in recognition of AI’s growing role in scientific and medical discovery. It explores 2023’s standout AI-facilitated scientific achievements, including advanced weather forecasting systems like GraphCast and improved material discovery algorithms like GNoME. The chapter also examines medical AI system performance, important 2023 AI-driven medical innovations like SynthSR and ImmunoSEIRA, and trends in the approval of FDA AI-related medical devices.\\n\\nDOWNLOAD CHAPTER 5\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                1. Scientific progress accelerates even further, thanks to AI.             \\n\\n\\n\\n                2. AI helps medicine take significant strides forward.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                3. Highly knowledgeable medical AI has arrived.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                4. The FDA approves more and more AI-related medical devices.             \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2022, AI began to advance scientific discovery. 2023, however, saw the launch of even more significant science-related AI applications—from AlphaDev, which makes algorithmic sorting more efficient, to GNoME, which facilitates the process of materials discovery.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2023, several significant medical systems were launched, including EVEscape, which enhances pandemic prediction, and AlphaMissence, which assists in AI-driven mutation classification. AI is increasingly being utilized to propel medical advancements.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nOver the past few years, AI systems have shown remarkable improvement on the MedQA benchmark, a key test for assessing AI’s clinical knowledge. The standout model of 2023, GPT-4 Medprompt, reached an accuracy rate of 90.2%, marking a 22.6 percentage point increase from the highest score in 2022. Since the benchmark’s introduction in 2019, AI performance on MedQA has nearly tripled.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n In 2022, the FDA approved 139 AI-related medical devices, a 12.1% increase from 2021. Since 2012, the number of FDA-approved AI-related medical devices has increased by more than 45-fold. AI is increasingly being used for real-world medical purposes.        \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 6: Education\\nThis chapter examines trends in AI and computer science (CS) education, focusing on who is learning, where they are learning, and how these trends have evolved over time. Amid growing concerns about AI’s impact on education, it also investigates the use of new AI tools like ChatGPT by teachers and students.The analysis begins with an overview of the state of postsecondary CS and AI education in the United States and Canada, based on the Computing Research Association’s annual Taulbee Survey. It then reviews data from Informatics Europe regarding CS education in Europe. This year introduces a new section with data from Studyportals on the global count of AI-related English-language study programs.\\xa0The chapter wraps up with insights into K–12 CS education in the United States from Code.org and findings from the Walton Foundation survey on ChatGPT’s use in schools.\\n\\nDOWNLOAD CHAPTER 6\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                1. The number of American and Canadian CS bachelor’s graduates continues to rise, new CS master’s graduates stay relatively flat, and PhD graduates modestly grow.             \\n\\n\\n\\n                2. The migration of AI PhDs to industry continues at an accelerating pace.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                3. Less transition of academic talent from industry to academia.             \\n\\n\\n\\n                4. CS education in the United States and Canada becomes less international.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                5. More American high school students take CS courses, but access problems remain.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                6. AI-related degree programs are on the rise internationally.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                7. The United Kingdom and Germany lead in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT graduate production.             \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile the number of new American and Canadian bachelor’s graduates has consistently risen for more than a decade, the number of students opting for graduate education in CS has flattened. Since 2018, the number of CS master’s and PhD graduates has slightly declined.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2011, roughly equal percentages of new AI PhDs took jobs in industry (40.9%) and academia (41.6%). However, by 2022, a significantly larger proportion (70.7%) joined industry after graduation compared to those entering academia (20.0%). Over the past year alone, the share of industry-bound AI PhDs has risen by 5.3 percentage points, indicating an intensifying brain drain from universities into industry.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2019, 13% of new AI faculty in the United States and Canada were from industry. By 2021, this figure had declined to 11%, and in 2022, it further dropped to 7%. This trend indicates a progressively lower migration of high-level AI talent from industry into academia.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nProportionally fewer international CS bachelor’s, master’s, and PhDs graduated in 2022 than in 2021. The drop in international students in the master’s category was especially pronounced.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n In 2022, 201,000 AP CS exams were administered. Since 2007, the number of students taking these exams has increased more than tenfold. However, recent evidence indicates that students in larger high schools and those in suburban areas are more likely to have access to CS courses.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of English-language, AI-related postsecondary degree programs has tripled since 2017, showing a steady annual increase over the past five years. Universities worldwide are offering more AI-focused degree programs.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe United Kingdom and Germany lead Europe in producing the highest number of new informatics, CS, CE, and information bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD graduates. On a per capita basis, Finland leads in the production of both bachelor’s and PhD graduates, while Ireland leads in the production of master’s graduates.        \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 7: Policy and Governance\\nAI’s increasing capabilities have captured policymakers’ attention. Over the past year, several nations and political bodies, such as the United States and the European Union, have enacted significant AI-related policies. The proliferation of these policies reflect policymakers’ growing awareness of the need to regulate AI and improve their respective countries’ ability to capitalize on its transformative potential.This chapter begins examining global AI governance starting with a timeline of significant AI policymaking events in 2023. It then analyzes global and U.S. AI legislative efforts, studies AI legislative mentions, and explores how lawmakers across the globe perceive and discuss AI. Next, the chapter profiles national AI strategies and regulatory efforts in the United States and the European Union. Finally, it concludes with a study of public investment in AI within the United States.\\n\\nDOWNLOAD CHAPTER 7\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                1. The number of AI regulations in the United States sharply increases.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                2. The United States and the European Union advance landmark AI policy action.             \\n\\n\\n\\n                3. AI captures U.S. policymaker attention.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                4. Policymakers across the globe cannot stop talking about AI.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                5. More regulatory agencies turn their attention toward AI.            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of AI-related regulations in the U.S. has risen significantly in the past year and over the last five years. In 2023, there were 25 AI-related regulations, up from just one in 2016. Last year alone, the total number of AI-related regulations grew by 56.3%.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2023, policymakers on both sides of the Atlantic put forth substantial AI regulatory proposals. The European Union reached a deal on the terms of the AI Act, a landmark piece of legislation enacted in 2024. Meanwhile, President Biden signed an Executive Order on AI, the most notable AI policy initiative in the United States that year.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe year 2023 witnessed a remarkable increase in AI-related legislation at the federal level, with 181 bills proposed, more than double the 88 proposed in 2022.         \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nMentions of AI in legislative proceedings across the globe have nearly doubled, rising from 1,247 in 2022 to 2,175 in 2023. AI was mentioned in the legislative proceedings of 49 countries in 2023. Moreover, at least one country from every continent discussed AI in 2023, underscoring the truly global reach of AI policy discourse.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe number of U.S. regulatory agencies issuing AI regulations increased to 21 in 2023 from 17 in 2022, indicating a growing concern over AI regulation among a broader array of American regulatory bodies. Some of the new regulatory agencies that enacted AI-related regulations for the first time in 2023 include the Department of Transportation, the Department of Energy, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.        \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 8: Diversity\\nThe demographics of AI developers often differ from those of users. For instance, a considerable number of prominent AI companies and the datasets utilized for model training originate from Western nations, thereby reflecting Western perspectives. The lack of diversity can perpetuate or even exacerbate societal inequalities and biases.This chapter delves into diversity trends in AI. The chapter begins by drawing on data from the Computing Research Association (CRA) to provide insights into the state of diversity in American and Canadian computer science (CS) departments. A notable addition to this year’s analysis is data sourced from Informatics Europe, which sheds light on diversity trends within European CS education. Next, the chapter examines participation rates at the Women in Machine Learning (WiML) workshop held annually at NeurIPS. Finally, the chapter analyzes data from Code.org, offering insights into the current state of diversity in secondary CS education across the United States.\\xa0The AI Index is dedicated to enhancing the coverage of data shared in this chapter. Demographic data regarding AI trends, particularly in areas such as sexual orientation, remains scarce. The AI Index urges other stakeholders in the AI domain to intensify their endeavors to track diversity trends associated with AI and hopes to comprehensively cover such trends in future reports.\\n\\nDOWNLOAD CHAPTER 8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                1. U.S. and Canadian bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD CS students continue to grow more ethnically diverse.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                2. Substantial gender gaps persist in European informatics, CS, CE, and IT graduates at all educational levels.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                3. U.S. K–12 CS education is growing more diverse, reflecting changes in both gender and ethnic representation.            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile white students continue to be the most represented ethnicity among new resident graduates at all three levels, the representation from other ethnic groups, such as Asian, Hispanic, and Black or African American students, continues to grow. For instance, since 2011, the proportion of Asian CS bachelor’s degree graduates has increased by 19.8 percentage points, and the proportion of Hispanic CS bachelor’s degree graduates has grown by 5.2 percentage points.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nEvery surveyed European country reported more male than female graduates in bachelor’s, master’s, and PhD programs for informatics, CS, CE, and IT. While the gender gaps have narrowed in most countries over the last decade, the rate of this narrowing has been slow.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nThe proportion of AP CS exams taken by female students rose from 16.8% in 2007 to 30.5% in 2022. Similarly, the participation of Asian, Hispanic/Latino/Latina, and Black/African American students in AP CS has consistently increased year over year.\\r\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\nChapter 9: Public Opinion\\nAs AI becomes increasingly ubiquitous, it is important to understand how public perceptions regarding the technology evolve. Understanding this public opinion is vital in better anticipating AI’s societal impacts and how the integration of the technology may differ across countries and demographic groups.This chapter examines public opinion on AI through global, national, demographic, and ethnic perspectives. It draws upon several data sources: longitudinal survey data from Ipsos profiling global AI attitudes over time, survey data from the University of Toronto exploring public perception of ChatGPT, and data from Pew examining American attitudes regarding AI. The chapter concludes by analyzing mentions of significant AI models on Twitter, using data from Quid.\\n\\nDOWNLOAD CHAPTER 9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                1. People across the globe are more cognizant of AI’s potential impact—and more nervous.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                2. AI sentiment in Western nations continues to be low, but is slowly improving.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                3. The public is pessimistic about AI’s economic impact.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                4. Demographic differences emerge regarding AI optimism.            \\n\\n\\n\\n                5. ChatGPT is widely known and widely used.            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nA survey from Ipsos shows that, over the last year, the proportion of those who think AI will dramatically affect their lives in the next three to five years has increased from 60% to 66%. Moreover, 52% express nervousness toward AI products and services, marking a 13 percentage point rise from 2022. In America, Pew data suggests that 52% of Americans report feeling more concerned than excited about AI, rising from 38% in 2022.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn 2022, several developed Western nations, including Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium, Canada, and the United States, were among the least positive about AI products and services. Since then, each of these countries has seen a rise in the proportion of respondents acknowledging the benefits of AI, with the Netherlands experiencing the most significant shift.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIn an Ipsos survey, only 37% of respondents feel AI will improve their job. Only 34% anticipate AI will boost the economy, and 32% believe it will enhance the job market.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nSignificant demographic differences exist in perceptions of AI’s potential to enhance livelihoods, with younger generations generally more optimistic. For instance, 59% of Gen Z respondents believe AI will improve entertainment options, versus only 40% of baby boomers. Additionally, individuals with higher incomes and education levels are more optimistic about AI’s positive impacts on entertainment, health, and the economy than their lower-income and less-educated counterparts.        \\n\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nAn international survey from the University of Toronto suggests that 63% of respondents are aware of ChatGPT. Of those aware, around half report using ChatGPT at least once weekly.\\r\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPast Reports\\n\\n\\n\\n2023\\n\\n\\n\\n2022\\n\\n\\n\\n2021\\n\\n\\n\\n2019\\n\\n\\n\\n2018\\n\\n\\n\\n2017\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Artificial Intelligence Index\\nStanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence\\nCordura Hall\\n201 Panama Street\\nStanford University\\nStanford, CA 94305 \\n\\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE HAI NEWSLETTER\\n\\nEmail\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\nLinkedIn\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStanford Home\\nMaps & Directions\\nSearch Stanford\\nEmergency Info\\n\\n\\nTerms of Use\\nPrivacy\\nCopyright\\nTrademarks\\nNon-Discrimination\\nAccessibility\\n\\n\\n© Stanford University.

Massive, centrally operated mainframe computers from a few players gave way to smaller, more efficient machines accessible to enterprises and research institutions. In the decades that followed, incremental advances yielded home computers that hobbyists could tinker with. In time, powerful personal computers with intuitive no-code interfaces became ubiquitous.\\nGenerative AI has already reached its “hobbyist” phase—and as with computers, further progress aims to attain greater performance in smaller packages. 2023 saw an explosion of increasingly efficient foundation models with open licenses, beginning with the launch of Meta’s LlaMa family of large language models (LLMs) and followed by the likes of StableLM, Falcon, Mistral, and Llama 2. DeepFloyd and Stable Diffusion have achieved relative parity with leading proprietary models. Enhanced with fine-tuning techniques and datasets developed by the open source community, many open models can now outperform all but the most powerful closed-source models on most benchmarks, despite far smaller parameter counts.\\nAs the pace of progress accelerates, the ever-expanding capabilities of state-of-the-art models will garner the most media attention. But the most impactful developments may be those focused on governance, middleware, training techniques and data pipelines that make generative AI more trustworthy, sustainable and accessible, for enterprises and end users alike.\\nHere are some important current AI trends to look out for in the coming year.\\nReality check: more realistic expectationsMultimodal AISmall(er) language models and open source advancementsGPU shortages and cloud costsModel optimization is getting more accessibleCustomized local models and data pipelinesMore powerful virtual agentsRegulation, copyright and ethical AI concernsShadow AI (and corporate AI policies)\\n\\n\\n\\nReality check: more realistic expectations\\n\\n\\nWhen generative AI first hit mass awareness, a typical business leader’s knowledge came mostly from marketing materials and breathless news coverage. Tangible experience (if any) was limited to messing around with ChatGPT and DALL-E. Now that the dust has settled, the business community now has a more refined understanding of AI-powered solutions.\\nThe Gartner Hype Cycle positions Generative AI squarely at “Peak of Inflated Expectations,” on the cusp of a slide into the “Trough of Disillusionment”[1]—in other words, about to enter a (relatively) underwhelming transition period—while Deloitte’s “State of Generated AI in the Enterprise “ report from Q1 2024 indicated that many leaders “expect substantial transformative impacts in the short term.”[2] The reality will likely fall in between: generative AI offers unique opportunities and solutions, but it will not be everything to everyone.\\nHow real-world results compare to the hype is partially a matter of perspective. Standalone tools like ChatGPT typically take center stage in the popular imagination, but smooth integration into established services often yields more staying power. Prior to the current hype cycle, generative machine learning tools like the “Smart Compose” feature rolled out by Google in 2018 weren’t heralded as a paradigm shift, despite being harbingers of today’s text generating services. Similarly, many high-impact generative AI tools are being implemented as integrated elements of enterprise environments that enhance and complement, rather than revolutionize or replace, existing tools: for example, “Copilot” features in Microsoft Office, “Generative Fill” features in Adobe Photoshop or virtual agents in productivity and collaboration apps.\\nWhere generative AI first builds momentum in everyday workflows will have more influence on the future of AI tools than the hypothetical upside of any specific AI capabilities. According to a recent IBM survey of over 1,000 employees at enterprise-scale companies, the top three factors driving AI adoption were advances in AI tools that make them more accessible, the need to reduce costs and automate key processes and the increasing amount of AI embedded into standard off-the-shelf business applications.\\n\\n\\n\\nMultimodal AI (and video)\\n\\n\\nThat being said, the ambition of state-of-the-art generative AI is growing. The next wave of advancements will focus not only on enhancing performance within a specific domain, but on multimodal models that can take multiple types of data as input. While models that operate across different data modalities are not a strictly new phenomenon—text-to-image models like CLIP and speech-to-text models like Wave2Vec have been around for years now—they’ve typically only operated in one direction, and were trained to accomplish a specific task.\\nThe incoming generation of interdisciplinary models, comprising proprietary models like OpenAI’s GPT-4V or Google’s Gemini, as well as open source models like LLaVa, Adept or Qwen-VL, can move freely between natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision tasks. New models are also bringing video into the fold: in late January, Google announced Lumiere, a text-to-video diffusion model that can also perform image-to-video tasks or use images for style reference.\\nThe most immediate benefit of multimodal AI is more intuitive, versatile AI applications and virtual assistants. Users can, for example, ask about an image and receive a natural language answer, or ask out loud for instructions to repair something and receive visual aids alongside step-by-step text instructions.\\nOn a higher level, multimodal AI allows for a model to process more diverse data inputs, enriching and expanding the information available for training and inference. Video, in particular, offers great potential for holistic learning. “There are cameras that are on 24/7 and they’re capturing what happens just as it happens without any filtering, without any intentionality,” says Peter Norvig, Distinguished Education Fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).[3] “AI models haven’t had that kind of data before. Those models will just have a better understanding of everything.”\\n\\n\\n\\nSmall(er) language models and open source advancements\\n\\n\\nIn domain-specific models—particularly LLMs—we’ve likely reached the point of diminishing returns from larger parameter counts. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI (whose GPT-4 model is rumored to have around 1.76 trillion parameters), suggested as much at MIT’s Imagination in Action event last April: “I think we’re at the end of the era where it’s going to be these giant models, and we’ll make them better in other ways,” he predicted. “I think there’s been way too much focus on parameter count.”\\nMassive models jumpstarted this ongoing AI golden age, but they’re not without drawbacks. Only the very largest companies have the funds and server space to train and maintain energy-hungry models with hundreds of billions of parameters. According to one estimate from the University of Washington, training a single GPT-3-sized model requires the yearly electricity consumption of over 1,000 households; a standard day of ChatGPT queries rivals the daily energy consumption of 33,000 U.S. households.[4]\\nSmaller models, meanwhile, are far less resource-intensive. An influential March 2022 paper\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) from Deepmind demonstrated that training smaller models on more data yields better performance than training larger models on fewer data. Much of the ongoing innovation in LLMs has thus focused on yielding greater output from fewer parameters. As demonstrated by recent progress of models in the 3–70 billion parameter range, particularly those built upon LLaMa, Llama 2 and Mistral foundation models in 2023, models can be downsized without much performance sacrifice.\\nThe power of open models will continue to grow. In December of 2023, Mistral released “Mixtral,” a mixture of experts (MoE) model integrating 8 neural networks, each with 7 billion parameters. Mistral claims that Mixtral not only outperforms the 70B parameter variant of Llama 2 on most benchmarks at 6 times faster inference speeds, but that it even matches or outperforms OpenAI’s far larger GPT-3.5 on most standard benchmarks. Shortly thereafter, Meta announced in January that it has already begun training of Llama 3 models, and confirmed that they will be open sourced. Though details (like model size) have not been confirmed, it’s reasonable to expect Llama 3 to follow the framework established in the two generations prior.\\nThese advances in smaller models have three important benefits:\\nThey help democratize AI: smaller models that can be run at lower cost on more attainable hardware empower more amateurs and institutions to study, train and improve existing models.They can be run locally on smaller devices: this allows more sophisticated AI in scenarios like edge computing and the internet of things (IoT). Furthermore, running models locally—like on a user’s smartphone—helps to sidestep many privacy and cybersecurity concerns that arise from interaction with sensitive personal or proprietary data.They make AI more explainable: the larger the model, the more difficult it is to pinpoint how and where it makes important decisions. Explainable AI is essential to understanding, improving and trusting the output of AI systems.\\n\\n\\n\\nGPU shortages and cloud costs\\n\\n\\nThe trend toward smaller models will be driven as much by necessity as by entrepreneurial vigor, as cloud computing costs increase as the availability of hardware decrease.\\n“The big companies (and more of them) are all trying to bring AI capabilities in-house, and there is a bit of a run on GPUs,” says James Landay, Vice-Director and Faculty Director of Research, Stanford HAI. “This will create a huge pressure not only for increased GPU production, but for innovators to come up with hardware solutions that are cheaper and easier to make and use.”1\\nAs a late 2023 O’Reilly report explains, cloud providers currently bear much of the computing burden: relatively few AI adopters maintain their own infrastructure, and hardware shortages will only elevate the hurdles and costs of setting up on-premise servers. In the long term, this may put upward pressure on cloud costs as providers update and optimize their own infrastructure to effectively meet demand from generative AI.[5]\\nFor enterprises, navigating this uncertain landscape requires flexibility, in terms of both models–leaning on smaller, more efficient models where necessary or larger, more performant models when practical–and deployment environment. “We don’t want to constrain where people deploy [a model],” said IBM CEO Arvind Krishna in a December 2023 interview with CNBC\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com), in reference to IBM’s watsonx platform. “So [if] they want to deploy it on a large public cloud, we’ll do it there. If they want to deploy it at IBM, we’ll do it at IBM. If they want to do it on their own, and they happen to have enough infrastructure, we’ll do it there.”\\n\\n\\n\\nModel optimization is getting more accessible\\n\\n\\nThe trend towards maximizing the performance of more compact models is well served by the recent output of the open source community.\\xa0\\nMany key advancements have been (and will continue to be) driven not just by new foundation models, but by new techniques and resources (like open source datasets) for training, tweaking, fine-tuning or aligning pre-trained models. Notable model-agnostic techniques that took hold in 2023 include:\\nLow Rank Adaptation (LoRA): Rather than directly fine-tuning billions of model parameters, LoRA entails freezing pre-trained model weights and injecting trainable layers—which represent the matrix of changes to model weights as 2 smaller (lower rank) matrices—in each transformer block. This dramatically reduces the number of parameters that need to be updated, which, in turn, dramatically speeds up fine-tuning and reduces memory needed to store model updates.Quantization: Like lowering the bitrate of audio or video to reduce file size and latency, quantization lowers the precision used to represent model data points—for example, from 16-bit floating point to 8-bit integer—to reduce memory usage and speed up inference. QLoRA techniques combine quantization with LoRA.Direct Preference Optimization (DPO): Chat models typically use reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align model outputs to human preferences. Though powerful, RLHF is complex and unstable. DPO promises similar benefits while being computationally lightweight and substantially simpler.\\nAlongside parallel advances in open source models in the 3–70 billion parameter space,\\xa0these evolving techniques could shift the dynamics of the AI landscape by providing smaller players, like startups and amateurs, with sophisticated AI capabilities that were previously out of reach.\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomized local models and data pipelines\\n\\n\\nEnterprises in 2024 can thus pursue differentiation through bespoke model development, rather than building wrappers around repackaged services from “Big AI.” With the right data and development framework, existing open source AI models and tools can be tailored to almost any real-world scenario, from customer support uses to supply chain management to complex document analysis.\\nOpen source models afford organizations the opportunity to develop powerful custom AI models—trained on their proprietary data and fine-tuned for their specific needs—quickly, without prohibitively expensive infrastructure investments. This is especially relevant in domains like legal, healthcare or finance, where highly specialized vocabulary and concepts may not have been learned by foundation models in pre-training.\\nLegal, finance and healthcare are also prime examples of industries that can benefit from models small enough to be run locally on modest hardware. Keeping AI training, inference and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) local avoids the risk of proprietary data or sensitive personal information being used to train closed-source models or otherwise pass through the hands of third parties. And using RAG to access relevant information rather than storing all knowledge directly within the LLM itself helps reduce model size, further increasing speed and reducing costs.\\nAs 2024 continues to level the model playing field, competitive advantage will increasingly be driven by proprietary data pipelines that enable industry-best fine-tuning.\\n\\n\\n\\nMore powerful virtual agents\\n\\n\\nWith more sophisticated, efficient tools and a year’s worth of market feedback at their disposal, businesses are primed to expand the use cases for virtual agents beyond just straightforward customer experience chatbots.\\nAs AI systems speed up and incorporate new streams and formats of information, they expand the possibilities for not just communication and instruction following, but also task automation. “2023 was the year of being able to chat with an AI. Multiple companies launched something, but the interaction was always you type something in and it types something back,” says Stanford’s Norvig. “In 2024, we’ll see the ability for agents to get stuff done for you. Make reservations, plan a trip, connect to other services.”\\nMultimodal AI, in particular, significantly increases opportunities for seamless interaction with virtual agents. For example, rather than simply asking a bot for recipes, a user can point a camera at an open fridge and request recipes that can be made with available ingredients. Be My Eyes, a mobile app that connects blind and low vision individuals with volunteers to help with quick tasks, is piloting AI tools that help users directly interact with their surroundings through multimodal AI in lieu of awaiting a human volunteer.\\nExplore IBM watsonx™ Assistant: market-leading conversational AI with seamless integration for the tools that power your business →\\n\\n\\n\\nRegulation, copyright and ethical AI concerns\\n\\n\\nElevated multimodal capabilities and lowered barriers to entry also open up new doors for abuse: deepfakes, privacy issues, perpetuation of bias and even evasion of CAPTCHA safeguards may become increasingly easy for bad actors. In January of 2024, a wave of explicit celebrity deepfakes hit social media; research from May 2023 indicated that there had been 8 times as many voice deepfakes posted online compared to the same period in 2022.[6]\\nAmbiguity in the regulatory environment may slow adoption, or at least more aggressive implementation, in the short to medium term. There is inherent risk to any major, irreversible investment in an emerging technology or practice that might require significant retooling—or even become illegal—following new legislation or changing political headwinds in the coming years.\\nIn December 2023, the European Union (EU) reached provisional agreement on the Artificial Intelligence Act\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com). Among other measures, it prohibits indiscriminate scraping of images to create facial recognition databases, biometric categorization systems with potential for discriminatory bias, “social scoring” systems and the use of AI for social or economic manipulation. It also seeks to define a category of “high-risk” AI systems, with potential to threaten safety, fundamental rights or rule of law, that will be subject to additional oversight. Likewise, it sets transparency requirements for what it calls “general-purpose AI (GPAI)” systems—foundation models—including technical documentation and systemic adversarial testing.\\nBut while some key players, like Mistral, reside in the EU, the majority of groundbreaking AI development is happening in America, where substantive legislation of AI in the private sector will require action from Congress—which may be unlikely in an election year. On October 30, the Biden administration issued a comprehensive executive order\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) detailing 150 requirements for use of AI technologies by federal agencies; months prior, the administration secured voluntary commitments from prominent AI developers\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com)\\xa0to adhere to certain guardrails for trust and security. Notably, both California and Colorado are actively pursuing their own legislation regarding individuals’ data privacy rights with regard to artificial intelligence.\\nChina has moved more proactively toward formal AI restrictions, banning price discrimination by recommendation algorithms on social media and mandating the clear labeling of AI-generated content. Prospective regulations on generative AI seek to require the training data used to train LLMs and the content subsequently generated by models must be “true and accurate,” which experts have taken to indicate measures to censor LLM output.\\nMeanwhile, the role of copyrighted material in the training of AI models used for content generation, from language models to image generators and video models, remains a hotly contested issue. The outcome of the high-profile lawsuit filed by the New York Times against OpenAI\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) may significantly affect the trajectory of AI legislation. Adversarial tools, like Glaze\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com) and Nightshade\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com)—both developed at the University of Chicago—have arisen in what may become an arms race of sorts between creators and model developers.\\n\\n\\n\\nShadow AI (and corporate AI policies)\\n\\n\\nFor businesses, this escalating potential for legal, regulatory, economic or reputational consequences is compounded by how popular and accessible generative AI tools have become. Organizations must not only have a careful, coherent and clearly articulated corporate policy around generative AI, but also be wary of\\xa0shadow AI:\\xa0the “unofficial” personal use of AI in the workplace by employees.\\nAlso dubbed “shadow IT” or “BYOAI,” shadow AI arises when impatient employees seeking quick solutions (or simply wanting to explore new tech faster than a cautious company policy allows) implement generative AI in the workplace without going through IT for approval or oversight. Many consumer-facing services, some free of charge, allow even nontechnical individuals to improvise the use of generative AI tools. In one study from Ernst & Young, 90% of respondents said they use AI at work.[7]\\nThat enterprising spirit can be great, in a vacuum—but eager employees may lack relevant information or perspective regarding security, privacy or compliance. This can expose businesses to a great deal of risk. For example, an employee might unknowingly feed trade secrets to a public-facing AI model that continually trains on user input, or use copyright-protected material to train a proprietary model for content generation and expose their company to legal action.\\nLike many ongoing developments, this underscores how the dangers of generative AI rise almost linearly with its capabilities. With great power comes great responsibility.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoving forward\\n\\n\\nAs we proceed through a pivotal year in artificial intelligence, understanding and adapting to emerging trends is essential to maximizing potential, minimizing risk and responsibly scaling generative AI adoption.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Author\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDave Bergmann\\nWriter,  Data & AI\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            \\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n    Footnotes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1“Gartner Places Generative AI on the Peak of Inflated Expectations on the 2023 Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0Gartner, 16 August 2023\\n2\\xa0”Deloitte’s State of Generative AI in the Enteprrise Quarter one report”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0Deloitte, January 2024\\n3\\xa0”What to Expect in AI in 2024”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0Stanford University, 8 December 2023\\n4\\xa0”Q&A: UW researcher discusses just how much energy ChatGPT uses”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0University of Washington, 27 July 2023\\n5\\xa0“Generative AI in the Enterprise”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0O’Reilly, 28 November 2023\\n6\\xa0”Deepfaking it: America’s 2024 election coincides with AI boom”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0Reuters, 30 May 2023\\n7\\xa0”How organizations can stop skyrocketing AI use from fueling anxiety”\\xa0(link resides outside ibm.com),\\xa0Ernst & Young, December 2023\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn how IBM® watsonx.governance™ accelerates responsible, transparent and explainable AI workflows →\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPut generative AI to work with watsonx™\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn how IBM can empower you to stay ahead of AI trends\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"

      "* **Regulation and Ethical Concerns:**  The growing capabilities of AI raise concerns about potential abuse, leading to increasing regulatory scrutiny and a focus on ethical AI development.\n",
      "* **Shadow AI:**  Businesses must implement clear AI policies and manage the risk of \"shadow AI\" – employees using AI tools without company approval or oversight.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Main Points:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* The article emphasizes the shift from massive, closed-source AI models to more accessible, open source alternatives, especially smaller models optimized for specific tasks.\n",
